# AST Parser Stress Test Specification

## Overview

This document specifies 10 devastating stress tests designed to expose critical vulnerabilities in AST parsing systems. These tests target fundamental weaknesses that can cause system failures, security vulnerabilities, and performance degradation.

## Critical Vulnerabilities Targeted

### 1. Silent Parser Failure
**Vulnerability**: Multiple language parser initialization can fail silently, leaving the system in a partially working state.

**Impact**: 
- System appears functional but fails on specific languages
- No error reporting for failed initialization
- Inconsistent behavior across different file types

**Test Strategy**: 
- Create indexer and verify ALL parsers loaded correctly
- Test each language with valid code that should parse successfully  
- Force parser state corruption through rapid recreation
- Detect and report any silent initialization failures

### 2. Persistence Absence  
**Vulnerability**: No persistence means symbol index must be rebuilt every time, causing catastrophic performance degradation.

**Impact**:
- Exponential time complexity for repeated operations
- System becomes unusable at scale
- Wasted computational resources

**Test Strategy**:
- Generate large code file with thousands of symbols
- Force complete rebuilds multiple iterations
- Measure and assert performance degradation
- Fail if average rebuild time exceeds usability threshold

### 3. Query Pattern Rigidity
**Vulnerability**: Fixed query patterns cannot adapt to code variations, missing symbols in edge cases.

**Impact**:
- Incomplete symbol extraction
- False negatives in search results
- Poor support for non-standard formatting

**Test Strategy**:
- Test unusual code formatting patterns
- Test nested and complex structures  
- Test macros, attributes, and language-specific constructs
- Test Unicode identifiers and edge cases
- Verify pattern flexibility and adaptation

### 4. Concurrency Symbol Corruption
**Vulnerability**: No thread safety leads to concurrent parsing corrupting symbol tables.

**Impact**:
- Data races and memory corruption
- Inconsistent symbol database state
- System crashes in multi-threaded environments

**Test Strategy**:
- Spawn multiple concurrent parsing threads
- Use shared symbol database
- Monitor for count inconsistencies and corruption
- Detect race conditions and thread safety violations

### 5. Memory Leak Validation
**Vulnerability**: AST nodes accumulate without cleanup causing memory leaks.

**Impact**:
- Unbounded memory growth
- System instability and crashes
- Resource exhaustion

**Test Strategy**:
- Create many indexers with large code blocks
- Monitor memory usage throughout lifecycle
- Verify memory release after cleanup
- Assert memory growth stays within bounds

### 6. Malformed Code Recovery
**Vulnerability**: Malformed source crashes parser with no recovery mechanism.

**Impact**:
- System crashes on invalid input
- No graceful error handling
- Security vulnerabilities from unhandled edge cases

**Test Strategy**:
- Test various malformed code patterns
- Test binary data disguised as source
- Test incomplete tokens and syntax errors
- Verify graceful failure or recovery
- Ensure no parser crashes or panics

### 7. Stack Overflow Induction  
**Vulnerability**: Large files cause stack overflow during traversal.

**Impact**:
- System crashes on large files
- Recursion limits cause failures
- Poor scalability

**Test Strategy**:
- Generate massively nested code structures
- Test deeply nested JSON/HTML/code
- Create files that trigger recursion limits
- Monitor for stack overflow and performance degradation
- Verify reasonable limits and error handling

### 8. Language Detection Chaos
**Vulnerability**: Mixed language files confuse language detection leading to incorrect parsing.

**Impact**:
- Wrong parser used for content
- Incorrect symbol extraction
- Failed processing of polyglot files

**Test Strategy**:
- Test JavaScript in HTML, CSS in HTML
- Test wrong file extensions
- Test mixed language constructs
- Test edge cases in extension detection
- Verify robust language detection

### 9. Circular Dependency Loops
**Vulnerability**: Circular dependencies cause infinite loops in dependency resolution.

**Impact**:
- System hangs indefinitely
- Resource exhaustion
- Deadlocks in dependency processing

**Test Strategy**:
- Create circular reference scenarios
- Monitor for infinite loops and timeouts
- Test dependency resolution performance
- Verify loop detection and handling
- Ensure reasonable timeout mechanisms

### 10. Unicode Symbol Extraction
**Vulnerability**: Unicode identifiers break symbol extraction due to encoding issues.

**Impact**:
- Loss of international code support
- Incomplete symbol databases
- ASCII-only bias in tooling

**Test Strategy**:
- Test various Unicode scripts (Cyrillic, Chinese, Arabic)
- Test emoji and special characters
- Test normalization issues (composed vs decomposed)
- Test right-to-left scripts
- Verify complete Unicode support

## Test Implementation

```

## Expected Results

### Pass Criteria
Tests should either:
1. **Pass**: System handles vulnerability correctly
2. **Fail gracefully**: System detects issue and reports error appropriately

### Failure Modes
Tests will **panic** or **fail** when:
1. **Silent failures**: Critical issues go undetected
2. **Performance degradation**: System becomes unusable
3. **Memory leaks**: Unbounded memory growth
4. **Thread safety violations**: Data races detected
5. **Parser crashes**: Unhandled panics or segfaults

### Critical vs Warning Failures

**Critical Failures** (System unusable):
- Concurrency Symbol Corruption
- Memory Leak Validation  
- Malformed Code Recovery (crashes)
- Stack Overflow Induction (crashes)
- Circular Dependency Loops (hangs)

**Warning Failures** (Degraded functionality):
- Silent Parser Failure
- Persistence Absence (performance)
- Query Pattern Rigidity
- Language Detection Chaos
- Unicode Symbol Extraction

## Performance Expectations

### Baseline Performance
- Small files (<1KB): <10ms parsing time
- Medium files (<100KB): <50ms parsing time  
- Large files (<1MB): <500ms parsing time
- Scaling factor: <10x for 100x file size increase

### Memory Usage
- Base memory usage: <50MB for indexer creation
- Growth per 1000 symbols: <10MB
- Memory release after cleanup: >80% recovered
- Peak usage: <200MB for stress tests

### Concurrency

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- Malformed code should not crash parser
- Binary data should be handled gracefully
- Extremely large inputs should fail with clear errors
- Unicode edge cases should not cause vulnerabilities

### Resource Limits
- Memory usage should be bounded
- Processing time should have reasonable limits
- Recursion depth should be limited to prevent stack overflow
- File size limits should be enforced

### Error Handling
- All errors should be caught and reported
- No silent failures or undefined behavior
- Clear error messages for debugging
- Graceful degradation when possible

### Adding New Vulnerability Tests
1. Identify specific vulnerability pattern
2. Design test to expose the vulnerability
3. Implement test with clear pass/fail criteria
4. Add test to `ast_parser_stress_tests.rs`
5. Update `Cargo.toml` if needed
6. Update test runner scripts
7. Document the new test

### Test Template
```rust
#[test]
fn test_new_vulnerability() {
    println!("🚨 TEST N: New Vulnerability Test");
    
    // Setup test conditions
    let mut indexer = SymbolIndexer::new().expect("Failed to create indexer");
    
    // Create vulnerability scenario
    let vulnerable_code = "...";
    
    // Execute test with monitoring
    let result = indexer.extract_symbols(vulnerable_code, "rust", "test.rs");
    
    // Verify expected behavior
    match result {
        Ok(symbols) => {
            // Validate symbols are correct
            assert!(!symbols.is_empty(), "Should extract symbols");
        }
        Err(e) => {
            // Verify graceful failure  
            println!("Graceful failure: {}", e);
        }
    }
    
    // Assert no vulnerability exploitation
    // panic! if vulnerability detected
}
```
