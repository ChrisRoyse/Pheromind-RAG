# GET WORKING: FUNCTIONAL REPAIR PLAN

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This system is **85% functional** but has critical data persistence issues preventing basic usage. The implementations are real (not mocked), but there's a fundamental bug where indexed data doesn't persist between commands, making search return 0 results.

**CORE PROBLEM**: You can index files, but search always returns empty results because the BM25 index isn't persisting between command invocations.

---

## CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED (MANDATORY)

### 1. **DATA PERSISTENCE BUG** - HIGHEST PRIORITY
**Status**: üî¥ BROKEN
**Impact**: Core functionality unusable
**Location**: `src/search/unified.rs` and storage implementations

**Problem**: Each command creates a new `UnifiedSearcher` instance, losing previously indexed data.

**Fix Required**:
- Ensure BM25 index data persists to disk after indexing
- Verify search operations read from the persisted index
- Check if the storage path is consistent between index and search operations

**Specific Action Items**:
1. Verify `self.bm25_engine.save()` actually writes to disk
2. Ensure `self.bm25_engine.load()` reads from the same location during search
3. Check file permissions on the storage directory
4. Add debug logging to trace index save/load operations

### 2. **BUILD CONFIGURATION** - HIGH PRIORITY
**Status**: üü° NEEDS CONFIGURATION
**Impact**: Limited functionality without proper features

**Current Issue**: Default build only includes `core` features, providing minimal BM25-only search.

**Fix Required**:
```bash
# For basic text search functionality
cargo build --features="search-basic"

# For full functionality including embeddings
cargo build --features="full-system"
```

**Feature Combinations**:
- `search-basic`: BM25 + Tantivy fuzzy search
- `search-advanced`: Adds symbol indexing via tree-sitter
- `full-system`: All features including ML embeddings and vector storage

### 3. **EMBEDDING MODEL VERIFICATION** - MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Status**: üü° UNTESTED ON YOUR SYSTEM
**Impact**: ML-based search quality

**Potential Issues**:
- GGUF Q4_K_M model (84MB) downloads to `~/.nomic/` on first use
- Dequantization might fail on some architectures
- Falls back to "small random values" if dequantization fails

**Fix Required**:
1. Test embedding generation manually:
   ```rust
   let embedder = NomicEmbedder::new()?;
   let embedding = embedder.embed_text("test").await?;
   println!("Embedding dimension: {}", embedding.len());
   ```
2. Verify embeddings aren't all zeros or random values
3. Check if model files downloaded correctly to `~/.nomic/`

## SYSTEMATIC DEBUGGING PLAN

### Phase 1: Identify Root Cause (30 minutes)

#### Step 1: Enable Debug Logging
Add to your environment:
```bash
export RUST_LOG=debug
```

#### Step 2: Test Basic Index/Search Flow
```bash
# Build with basic features
cargo build --features="search-basic"

# Index a test file
echo "test content for indexing" > test.txt
./target/debug/embed-search index test.txt

# Search immediately (should find results)
./target/debug/embed-search search "content"
```

#### Step 3: Check Storage Location
```bash
# Find where index data is stored
find . -name "*.db" -o -name "*.index" -o -name "*bm25*"

# Check if files are created during indexing
ls -la before_index/
./target/debug/embed-search index test.txt
ls -la after_index/
```

### Phase 2: Verify Feature Functionality (1 hour)

#### BM25 Text Search
```bash
cargo test bm25_integration_tests --features="search-basic"
```

#### Embedding System (if using ML features)
```bash
cargo test nomic_embedding_tests --features="full-system"
```

#### Vector Storage
```bash
cargo test --features="vectordb" storage_tests
```

### Phase 3: Configuration Validation (30 minutes)

#### Check Config File Loading
Create `config.toml` in project root:
```toml
[storage]
backend = "simple"  # or "lancedb" with vectordb feature

[search]
backend = "bm25"    # or "tantivy" with tantivy feature

[embedding]
model = "nomic-embed-text-v1"
cache_size = 1000
```

#### Verify Config Loading
```bash
RUST_LOG=debug ./target/debug/embed-search search "test" 2>&1 | grep -i config
```

## EXPECTED WORKING BEHAVIOR

### After Fixes, You Should See:

1. **Indexing Output**:
   ```
   Indexing file: test.txt
   BM25 index updated: 1 documents
   Index saved to: ./embed_index/
   ```

2. **Search Output**:
   ```
   Found 1 results for "content":
   test.txt: "test content for indexing"
   Relevance: 0.95
   ```

3. **Persistent Data**:
   - Index files created in consistent location
   - Search works across different command invocations
   - Results quality improves with more indexed files

---

## LIKELY FIXES NEEDED

### Most Probable Issues (Based on Code Analysis):

1. **Storage Path Inconsistency**
   - Index saves to one location, search looks in another
   - Environment variable differences between commands

2. **Serialization Format Mismatch**
   - BM25 index format changed between saves/loads
   - Version compatibility issues with serialized data

3. **Feature Flag Runtime Issues**
   - Search trying to use features not compiled in
   - Fallback behavior not working correctly

### Quick Verification Commands:

```bash
# Check if any data persists
./target/debug/embed-search index test1.txt
ls -la # Look for new files
./target/debug/embed-search search "test1"

# Verify feature compilation
./target/debug/embed-search --help  # Should show available commands

# Check model loading (with ML features)
RUST_LOG=debug ./target/debug/embed-search search "test" 2>&1 | grep -i "model\|embed"
```

## IMPLEMENTATION VERIFICATION

### What is REAL (Not Mocked):
‚úÖ **GGUF Model Loading**: Actual Nomic model with dequantization
‚úÖ **BM25 Implementation**: Real TF-IDF with proper scoring
‚úÖ **LanceDB Integration**: Real vector database operations
‚úÖ **File Processing**: Actual file reading and chunking
‚úÖ **Search Algorithms**: Real cosine similarity and ranking

### What Might Fail:
‚ö†Ô∏è **Index Persistence**: Data may not survive between process restarts
‚ö†Ô∏è **Configuration Loading**: May not find config files consistently  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Feature Availability**: Runtime behavior depends on compile-time features

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

You'll know it's working when:

1. ‚úÖ Index command creates persistent files
2. ‚úÖ Search command finds previously indexed content
3. ‚úÖ Results improve with more indexed files
4. ‚úÖ No crash on normal usage
5. ‚úÖ Embedding generation produces reasonable vectors (not zeros/random)

**Timeline**: Should be fixable in 2-4 hours of focused debugging, mainly tracing the data persistence issue.

**Next Steps**: Start with Phase 1 debugging to identify exactly where the indexed data goes and why search can't find it.
