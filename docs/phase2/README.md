# Phase 2: Search & Simple Fusion - Implementation Guide

## Overview

Phase 2 implements the unified search system that combines exact text matching (via ripgrep) with semantic similarity search (via vector embeddings). This phase is critical for achieving the 85% accuracy target through simple, proven techniques.

## Key Components

### 1. Vector Similarity Search (Task 011)
- Implements ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor) search using LanceDB
- Converts query text to embeddings and finds similar code chunks
- 12 atomic micro tasks, each taking ~15 minutes

### 2. Simple Fusion Algorithm (Task 012)
- Combines exact and semantic search results
- Uses basic scoring: exact matches get 1.0, semantic matches get 0.8
- Handles deduplication to avoid showing the same result twice
- 12 atomic micro tasks

### 3. Complete Search Pipeline (Task 013)
- Integrates all components into a unified search interface
- Implements the critical 3-chunk context expansion
- Handles async execution for performance
- 16 atomic micro tasks (largest component)

### 4. Result Ranking Optimization (Task 014)
- Simple heuristics to improve result relevance
- Boosts results where query appears in target chunk
- Penalizes overly large chunks
- 8 atomic micro tasks

### 5. Parallel Search Execution (Task 015)
- Runs exact and semantic search concurrently
- Reduces overall search latency
- 8 atomic micro tasks

### 6. Quality & Performance Tasks (Tasks 016-020)
- Search result caching (8 micro tasks)
- Query preprocessing (8 micro tasks)
- Search metrics tracking (8 micro tasks)
- Error handling (4 micro tasks)
- Integration testing (4 micro tasks)

## Implementation Strategy

### TDD Approach (Red-Green-Refactor)
1. **Red**: Write failing test first
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to make test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green

### Time Management
- Total micro tasks: 100
- Time per task: 15 minutes maximum
- Total estimated time: 25 hours
- Buffer: 5 hours for unexpected issues

### Key Success Factors
1. **Simplicity**: Avoid over-engineering, use proven patterns
2. **Test Coverage**: Aim for >90% test coverage
3. **Performance**: Must achieve <500ms search latency
4. **Accuracy**: Must achieve >70% search accuracy

## Files Created

1. `PHASE2_ATOMIC_TASKS.md` - Complete breakdown of all 100 micro tasks
2. `README.md` - This overview document

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation with Task 011.1 (Setup Vector Search Test Infrastructure)
2. Follow TDD strictly - no code without failing test first
3. Track progress using the micro task checklist
4. Run integration tests after each major task (011-020)
5. Measure performance and accuracy continuously

## Critical Metrics to Track

- **Search Latency**: Target <500ms average
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor during vector operations
- **Accuracy**: Test with real code search scenarios
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Should improve over time
- **Error Rate**: Should be <1% in production

## Dependencies

- Phase 1 must be complete (embedding infrastructure)
- LanceDB must be properly configured
- Ripgrep must be installed and accessible
- Test dataset must be prepared

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Performance Risk**: Start measuring early, optimize as needed
2. **Accuracy Risk**: Test with diverse code samples
3. **Integration Risk**: Test components in isolation first
4. **Complexity Risk**: Keep fusion algorithm simple

Remember: The 3-chunk context strategy provides 55% of our accuracy gains. Ensure this is working correctly before optimizing other areas.
