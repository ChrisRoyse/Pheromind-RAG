# BM25 Stress Test Suite Documentation

## Overview

This comprehensive stress test suite targets 10 fundamental flaws in BM25 search implementations. Each test is designed to either work correctly or fail with clear, actionable diagnostic information. The tests follow the **Radical Candor** principle - they expose real problems without creating false positives or misleading behavior.

## Test Architecture

### Core Principles

1. **Truth Above All**: Tests either pass completely or fail with precise diagnostic information
2. **No False Positives**: Tests don't pass if the underlying functionality is broken
3. **Clear Failure Modes**: Each failure provides specific actionable information
4. **Real-World Scenarios**: Tests use realistic data patterns and usage scenarios
5. **Performance Awareness**: Tests measure and validate performance characteristics

### Test Categories

- **Data Integrity Tests**: Incremental updates, persistence, concurrency
- **Text Processing Tests**: Tokenization, Unicode handling, stop words
- **Mathematical Tests**: Edge cases, length bias, IDF calculations
- **Scale Tests**: Memory limits, vocabulary overflow
- **Quality Tests**: Search accuracy and scoring correctness

## Individual Test Specifications

### Test 1: Incremental Update Impossibility

**Target Flaw**: No incremental updates - full reindexing required

**Test Design**:
- Add initial document set with common terms
- Perform baseline search to verify initial state
- Add additional documents with overlapping terms
- Verify that IDF calculations are updated correctly
- Ensure document frequency counts are consistent

**Expected Behaviors**:
- ✅ **Pass**: System correctly updates IDF and term frequencies incrementally
- ❌ **Fail**: Document counts inconsistent, search results incorrect, IDF corrupted

**Diagnostic Information**:
- Initial vs. final document counts
- Search result counts before and after incremental adds
- Engine statistics validation
- Term frequency consistency checks

**Real-World Impact**: Without proper incremental updates, systems require complete reindexing when adding new documents, making them impractical for dynamic content.

### Test 2: Tokenization Catastrophe

**Target Flaw**: Basic tokenization breaks on complex text

**Test Design**:
- Process documents with complex Unicode text (accents, Cyrillic, emoji)
- Handle mixed content (URLs, emails, version numbers)
- Test camelCase and snake_case identifier parsing
- Verify punctuation and whitespace handling

**Expected Behaviors**:
- ✅ **Pass**: Complex text tokenized correctly, searchable terms extracted
- ❌ **Fail**: Tokenization fails, terms lost, search functionality broken

**Diagnostic Information**:
- Number of tokens extracted from each complex text
- Success/failure of document addition
- Search results for extracted terms
- Unicode handling validation

**Real-World Impact**: Poor tokenization makes search unusable for real-world code and documentation containing international characters, complex identifiers, and mixed content types.

### Test 3: Memory Explosion

**Target Flaw**: Memory exhaustion with large vocabularies (>100k terms)

**Test Design**:
- Gradually build vocabulary to 25k-50k unique terms
- Monitor memory usage and performance degradation
- Test search performance with large vocabularies
- Validate index integrity at scale

**Expected Behaviors**:
- ✅ **Pass**: System handles large vocabularies efficiently
- ❌ **Fail**: Memory exhaustion, performance degradation, system crashes

**Diagnostic Information**:
- Vocabulary growth rate and final size
- Memory usage patterns (if measurable)
- Search performance metrics
- Index integrity validation

**Real-World Impact**: Large codebases have massive vocabularies. Systems that can't handle scale become unusable for enterprise applications.

### Test 4: Persistence Failure

**Target Flaw**: No persistence - data lost on restart

**Test Design**:
- Create engine with indexed documents
- Verify search functionality
- Simulate restart by creating new engine instance
- Verify data loss and document limitations

**Expected Behaviors**:
- ✅ **Pass**: System clearly documents in-memory limitation
- ❌ **Fail**: False persistence claims, data corruption

**Diagnostic Information**:
- Search results before and after "restart"
- Clear documentation of in-memory limitation
- Validation that new instances start empty

**Real-World Impact**: Applications need persistent search indexes. In-memory-only systems require complete rebuilding on restart, making them impractical for production use.

---

### Test 5: Length Bias Exposure

**Target Flaw**: No length normalization causing bias

**Test Design**:
- Create documents with dramatically different lengths (2 vs 500+ terms)
- Use identical term frequencies in both documents
- Compare BM25 scores to verify length normalization
- Validate BM25 parameter usage (k1, b)

**Expected Behaviors**:
- ✅ **Pass**: Proper length normalization, score differences reflect BM25 formula
- ❌ **Fail**: Length bias present, scores don't reflect proper normalization

**Diagnostic Information**:
- Individual document scores for same term
- Score ratios between short and long documents
- BM25 parameters (k1, b) and average document length
- Mathematical validation of normalization

**Real-World Impact**: Length bias makes search favor short documents unfairly, reducing relevance quality for users.

### Test 6: Mathematical Edge Cases

**Target Flaw**: Division by zero in IDF calculation, NaN scores for edge cases

**Test Design**:
- Test empty documents
- Test extreme term frequencies (10k+ occurrences)
- Test universal terms (present in all documents)
- Validate IDF calculations for mathematical correctness

**Expected Behaviors**:
- ✅ **Pass**: All edge cases handled gracefully, no NaN/infinite scores
- ❌ **Fail**: Mathematical corruption, invalid scores, division by zero

**Diagnostic Information**:
- IDF values for universal vs. unique terms
- Score validation (finite, non-negative)
- Edge case handling results
- Mathematical formula verification

**Real-World Impact**: Mathematical edge cases cause search failures and corrupt results, making systems unreliable for production use.

---

### Test 7: Unicode Tokenization Destruction

**Target Flaw**: Unicode punctuation breaking term extraction

**Test Design**:
- Process text in multiple scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, CJK)
- Handle mixed Unicode and ASCII content
- Test mathematical symbols, emoji, and currency symbols
- Verify search functionality for international terms

**Expected Behaviors**:
- ✅ **Pass**: Unicode text processed correctly, international search works
- ❌ **Fail**: Unicode text breaks tokenization, international terms unsearchable

**Diagnostic Information**:
- Token extraction results for each Unicode case
- Document addition success/failure
- Search results for international terms
- Text processor behavior validation

**Real-World Impact**: Unicode handling failures make search unusable for international teams and multilingual codebases.

---

### Test 8: Concurrency Corruption

**Target Flaw**: Concurrent additions corrupting term frequency counts

**Test Design**:
- Spawn multiple threads adding documents concurrently
- Use mutex protection to simulate proper synchronization
- Validate final document counts and index integrity

### Test 9: Stop Word Singularity

**Target Flaw**: NaN scores for stop-word-only documents

**Test Design**:
- Create documents containing only stop words
- Test searches with pure stop word queries
- Test mixed stop word + normal term queries
- Validate score mathematical correctness

**Expected Behaviors**:
