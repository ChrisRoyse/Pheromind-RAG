# MASTER PLAN: Making Embed Search Actually Work

**Status**: System is 60% broken. No fallbacks, no workarounds - just fixes.  
**Timeline**: 7 phases, approximately 2-3 weeks  
**Goal**: Full operational system with all 4 search methods working in parallel

## THE BRUTAL TRUTH

This system promises 4 parallel search methods but delivers ZERO working searches:
- BM25 returns 0 results when expecting 2
- Tantivy won't compile
- ML/Vector system has 8+ compilation errors
- Integration layer can't coordinate anything

**No sugar-coating**: This is a sophisticated design with amateur implementation errors.

## PHASE BREAKDOWN

### Phase 1: Stop the Bleeding (Day 1)
Fix compilation errors so we can at least build the system

### Phase 2: Core Search Repair (Day 2)
Make BM25 actually return results

### Phase 3: Tantivy Resurrection (Day 3)
Fix the API incompatibility that's killing full-text search

### Phase 4: ML/Vector Overhaul (Days 4-5)
Complete rewrite of broken storage and embedding systems

### Phase 5: Integration Surgery (Day 6)
Fix the unified search coordinator

### Phase 6: Testing Reality Check (Day 7)
Verify everything actually works - no fake tests

### Phase 7: Production Hardening (Week 2)
Performance, monitoring, documentation

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

Each phase must meet these criteria before moving forward:
1. Code compiles without errors
2. Tests pass (real tests, not mocked)
3. Features work as documented
4. No silent failures or fallbacks
5. Proper error messages for actual failures

## NO COMPROMISE RULES

1. **No Fallbacks**: If ML doesn't work, the system fails with a clear error
2. **No Mocking**: Tests must use real components
3. **No Shortcuts**: Fix the root cause, not symptoms
4. **No Lies**: If something doesn't work, it says so clearly
5. **No Partial Features**: Either it works fully or it doesn't ship
