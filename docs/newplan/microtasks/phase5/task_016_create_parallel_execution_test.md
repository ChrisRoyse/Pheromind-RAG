# Task 016: Create Parallel Execution Test

## Objective
Create comprehensive test for parallel execution of all search methods.

## Context
Need to verify that all search methods execute in parallel correctly and results are merged properly.

## Actions Required
1. Create test that verifies parallel execution
2. Test timing to ensure parallelism (not sequential)
3. Verify all methods are called concurrently
4. Test result fusion from parallel execution

## Expected Outcome
- Parallel execution verified through testing
- Performance benefits demonstrated
- Result fusion accuracy confirmed

## Files to Create
- `tests/integration/parallel_execution_test.rs`

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Parallel execution test passes
- [ ] Timing confirms parallelism
- [ ] Result fusion works correctly

## Time Estimate: 10 minutes

## Priority: HIGH
Critical integration verification.
