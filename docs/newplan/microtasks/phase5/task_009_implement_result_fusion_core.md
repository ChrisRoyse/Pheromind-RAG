# Task 009: Implement Result Fusion Core Logic

## Objective
Implement the core result fusion logic to combine results from multiple search methods.

## Context
Need to merge results from different search methods into a unified ranked list.

## Actions Required
1. Implement simple weighted fusion algorithm
2. Add result deduplication by content/path
3. Create configurable weight system for different methods
4. Handle cases where some methods return no results

## Expected Outcome
- Multiple search results are properly merged
- Deduplication prevents duplicate results
- Configurable weighting system works

## Files to Modify
- `src/search/fusion.rs` (create)
- `src/search/unified_searcher.rs`

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Fusion algorithm implemented
- [ ] Deduplication works correctly
- [ ] Weight configuration functional

## Time Estimate: 10 minutes

## Priority: HIGH
Core functionality for unified search.
