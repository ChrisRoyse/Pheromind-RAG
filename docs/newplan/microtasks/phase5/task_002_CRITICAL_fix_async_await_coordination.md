# Task 002: CRITICAL - Fix Async/Await Coordination

## Objective
Fix async/await handling in UnifiedSearcher to properly coordinate parallel search execution.

## Context
Current async implementation has await mismatches and improper Future handling.

## Actions Required
1. Fix async function signatures across all search methods
2. Implement proper Future handling for parallel execution
3. Add tokio::join! for coordinating multiple async search calls
4. Handle timeout and cancellation properly

## Expected Outcome
- All search methods execute in parallel correctly
- Proper async coordination without blocking
- Timeout handling works as expected

## Files to Modify
- `src/search/unified_searcher.rs`
- Individual search method implementations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Async compilation errors resolved
- [ ] Parallel execution works correctly
- [ ] No blocking operations in async context

## Time Estimate: 10 minutes

## Priority: CRITICAL
Required for basic functionality.
