# Task 017: Create Fusion Logic Test

## Objective
Create comprehensive test for result fusion logic and score normalization.

## Context
Need to verify that result fusion produces accurate and consistent rankings.

## Actions Required
1. Create test data with known optimal rankings
2. Test fusion algorithm accuracy
3. Verify score normalization works correctly
4. Test deduplication logic

## Expected Outcome
- Fusion accuracy verified
- Score normalization tested
- Deduplication working correctly

## Files to Create
- `tests/integration/fusion_logic_test.rs`

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Fusion logic test passes
- [ ] Score normalization verified
- [ ] Deduplication works correctly

## Time Estimate: 10 minutes

## Priority: HIGH
Core functionality verification.
