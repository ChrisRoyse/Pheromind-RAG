# Task 015: Implement Circuit Breaker Pattern

## Objective
Add circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures in search methods.

## Context
If a search method repeatedly fails, it should be temporarily disabled.

## Actions Required
1. Implement circuit breaker for each search method
2. Add failure threshold configuration
3. Implement automatic recovery after timeout
4. Add circuit breaker status monitoring

## Expected Outcome
- Failing methods temporarily disabled
- Automatic recovery when methods recover
- System stability improved

## Files to Modify
- `src/search/circuit_breaker.rs` (create)
- `src/search/unified_searcher.rs`

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern implemented
- [ ] Configurable thresholds work
- [ ] Automatic recovery functional

## Time Estimate: 10 minutes

## Priority: LOW
Advanced reliability feature.
