# Task 014: Add Partial Failure Handling

## Objective
Implement graceful handling when some search methods fail while others succeed.

## Context
UnifiedSearcher should continue working even if individual search methods fail.

## Actions Required
1. Implement partial failure detection
2. Add fallback logic when methods fail
3. Log failures appropriately for debugging
4. Ensure at least one method always works (native)

## Expected Outcome
- Graceful degradation when methods fail
- Appropriate logging of failures
- System remains functional with partial failures

## Files to Modify
- `src/search/unified_searcher.rs`
- `src/search/errors.rs`

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Partial failures handled gracefully
- [ ] Appropriate error logging
- [ ] System remains functional

## Time Estimate: 10 minutes

## Priority: MEDIUM
Important for system reliability.
