# Task 019: Create Performance Benchmark Test

## Objective
Create performance benchmark test to verify UnifiedSearcher performance characteristics.

## Context
Need to measure and verify that UnifiedSearcher provides performance benefits over individual methods.

## Actions Required
1. Create benchmark comparing unified vs individual method performance
2. Test parallel execution performance benefits
3. Measure cache effectiveness across methods
4. Test memory usage and resource efficiency

## Expected Outcome
- Performance benchmarks demonstrate benefits
- Parallel execution shows speed improvements
- Resource usage is reasonable

## Files to Create
- `tests/benchmarks/unified_searcher_benchmark.rs`

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Performance benchmark passes
- [ ] Parallel execution benefits demonstrated
- [ ] Resource usage acceptable

## Time Estimate: 10 minutes

## Priority: MEDIUM
Performance verification.
