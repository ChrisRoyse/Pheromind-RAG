# Task 044: Cache Size Tuning

## Overview
Optimize cache sizes across different cache layers to maximize hit rates while minimizing memory usage.

## Objectives
- Analyze cache hit/miss patterns
- Optimize cache sizes for different data types
- Balance memory usage with performance
- Implement dynamic cache sizing

## Requirements
- Cache performance analysis and metrics
- Size optimization for L1, L2, and external caches
- Memory pressure-aware cache eviction
- Dynamic size adjustment based on workload

## Implementation Steps
1. Implement cache performance monitoring
2. Analyze hit/miss ratios and memory usage
3. Optimize cache sizes for different access patterns
4. Create dynamic cache sizing algorithms
5. Add cache tuning recommendations and automation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cache hit rates optimized for each cache layer
- [ ] Memory usage balanced with performance needs
- [ ] Dynamic sizing responds to workload changes
- [ ] Cache efficiency improved by >25%
- [ ] Automated tuning recommendations provided
