# Task 025: Log Aggregation Setup

## Overview
Set up centralized log aggregation system for collecting, processing, and analyzing logs from all services.

## Objectives
- Configure log shipping to central location
- Set up log parsing and indexing
- Enable log search and analysis
- Implement log retention policies

## Requirements
- ELK stack or similar log aggregation platform
- Log shipping configuration (Fluentd, Filebeat, etc.)
- Index patterns and field mapping
- Search and alerting capabilities

## Implementation Steps
1. Configure log shipping agents
2. Set up log aggregation pipeline
3. Define index patterns and mappings
4. Configure retention and archival policies
5. Create log analysis dashboards

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Logs successfully shipped to central location
- [ ] Log parsing extracts structured fields correctly
- [ ] Search functionality works across all logs
- [ ] Retention policies automatically archive old logs
- [ ] Dashboards provide useful log analysis views

## Dependencies
- Distributed tracing (task_024)
- Structured logging implementation

## Estimated Time
10 minutes

## Files to Modify/Create
- `config/logging/fluentd.conf` - Log shipping configuration
- `config/logging/elasticsearch_mapping.json` - Index mappings
- `scripts/setup_log_aggregation.sh` - Setup automation

## Testing Strategy
- Log shipping verification tests
- Search functionality tests
- Retention policy validation tests
