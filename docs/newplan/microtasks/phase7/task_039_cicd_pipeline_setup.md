# Task 039: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

## Overview
Set up comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, building, and deployment of the application.

## Objectives
- Automate testing and quality checks
- Build and push Docker images
- Deploy to staging and production environments
- Implement rollback capabilities

## Requirements
- GitHub Actions or GitLab CI pipeline
- Automated testing (unit, integration, security)
- Docker image building and registry push
- Deployment automation with approval gates

## Implementation Steps
1. Create CI pipeline configuration
2. Set up automated testing stages
3. Configure Docker image building and pushing
4. Implement deployment automation
5. Add rollback and monitoring capabilities

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Pipeline runs on code changes automatically
- [ ] All tests must pass before deployment
- [ ] Docker images built and pushed to registry
- [ ] Deployment requires manual approval for production
- [ ] Rollback mechanism works correctly

## Dependencies
- ConfigMap and secrets (task_038)
- Complete test suite

## Estimated Time
10 minutes

## Files to Modify/Create
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - GitHub Actions pipeline
- `scripts/deploy.sh` - Deployment automation script
- `scripts/rollback.sh` - Rollback automation

## Testing Strategy
- Pipeline execution verification tests
- Deployment success validation tests
- Rollback functionality tests
- Integration with monitoring systems
