# Task 042: CPU Profiling with Flamegraphs

## Overview
Implement CPU profiling with flamegraph generation for performance bottleneck identification and optimization.

## Objectives
- Set up CPU profiling infrastructure
- Generate interactive flamegraph visualizations
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Enable continuous profiling in production

## Requirements
- CPU profiling integration (pprof, perf, or similar)
- Flamegraph generation and visualization
- Low-overhead continuous profiling
- Integration with monitoring systems

## Implementation Steps
1. Integrate CPU profiling framework
2. Set up flamegraph generation pipeline
3. Create profiling endpoint and triggers
4. Implement continuous profiling with sampling
5. Add flamegraph analysis and reporting tools

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CPU profiling captures accurate performance data
- [ ] Flamegraphs clearly visualize call stacks and hotspots
- [ ] Profiling overhead remains under 5%
- [ ] Continuous profiling runs in production safely
- [ ] Analysis tools identify optimization opportunities

## Dependencies
- Auto-scaling configuration (task_041)

## Estimated Time
10 minutes

## Files to Modify/Create
- `src/profiling/cpu_profiler.rs` - CPU profiling implementation
- `scripts/generate_flamegraph.sh` - Flamegraph generation script
- `src/profiling/continuous_profiler.rs` - Continuous profiling logic

## Testing Strategy
- Profiling accuracy verification tests
- Flamegraph generation validation tests
- Performance overhead measurement tests
- Production safety validation tests
