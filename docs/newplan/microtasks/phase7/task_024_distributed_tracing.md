# Task 024: Distributed Tracing

## Overview
Implement distributed tracing to track requests across multiple services and components.

## Objectives
- Enable cross-service request tracing
- Implement trace context propagation
- Add distributed trace correlation
- Support trace sampling strategies

## Requirements
- Trace context propagation via HTTP headers
- Cross-service correlation IDs
- Configurable sampling rates
- Integration with service mesh (if applicable)

## Implementation Steps
1. Implement trace context propagation
2. Add correlation ID generation and propagation
3. Configure trace sampling strategies
4. Create cross-service tracing utilities
5. Add end-to-end tracing tests

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Trace context propagates across service boundaries
- [ ] Correlation IDs maintained throughout request lifecycle
- [ ] Sampling strategies reduce overhead appropriately
- [ ] Distributed traces visible in tracing UI
- [ ] End-to-end tests verify complete trace flows

## Dependencies
- OpenTelemetry setup (task_023)
- HTTP client/server infrastructure

## Estimated Time
10 minutes

## Files to Modify/Create
- `src/tracing/distributed.rs` - Distributed tracing logic
- `src/tracing/context_propagation.rs` - Context propagation utilities
- `tests/integration/distributed_tracing_tests.rs` - Integration tests

## Testing Strategy
- Context propagation verification tests
- Cross-service trace correlation tests
- Sampling strategy effectiveness tests
