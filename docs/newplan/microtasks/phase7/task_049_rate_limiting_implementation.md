# Task 049: Rate Limiting Implementation

## Overview
Implement comprehensive rate limiting system to prevent abuse and ensure fair resource usage across clients.

## Objectives
- Implement multiple rate limiting strategies
- Support different limits for different endpoints
- Add rate limiting bypass for trusted clients
- Provide clear rate limit feedback to clients

## Requirements
- Token bucket and sliding window rate limiters
- Per-endpoint and per-client rate limits
- IP-based and authenticated user rate limiting
- Rate limit headers and error responses

## Implementation Steps
1. Implement token bucket and sliding window algorithms
2. Create per-endpoint rate limiting configuration
3. Add IP-based and user-based rate limiting
4. Implement rate limit headers and responses
5. Add rate limiting monitoring and alerting

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse effectively
- [ ] Different limits enforced for different endpoints
- [ ] Trusted clients can bypass rate limits appropriately
- [ ] Clients receive clear rate limit information
- [ ] Rate limiting events are monitored and alerted

## Dependencies
- Input validation and sanitization (task_048)

## Estimated Time
10 minutes

## Files to Modify/Create
- `src/security/rate_limiter.rs` - Rate limiting implementation
- `src/security/rate_limit_config.rs` - Rate limiting configuration
- `src/middleware/rate_limit_middleware.rs` - HTTP middleware

## Testing Strategy
- Rate limiting algorithm accuracy tests
- Per-endpoint limit enforcement tests
- Bypass mechanism validation tests
- Client feedback accuracy tests
