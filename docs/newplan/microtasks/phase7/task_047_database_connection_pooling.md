# Task 047: Database Connection Pooling

## Overview
Implement optimized database connection pooling for efficient resource utilization and improved database performance.

## Objectives
- Set up connection pool with optimal sizing
- Implement connection lifecycle management
- Add monitoring and health checking
- Optimize for different workload patterns

## Requirements
- Connection pool with configurable min/max connections
- Connection health monitoring and validation
- Connection timeout and retry strategies
- Pool performance metrics and optimization

## Implementation Steps
1. Implement connection pool with lifecycle management
2. Add connection health checking and validation
3. Configure timeout and retry strategies
4. Implement pool monitoring and metrics
5. Add workload-based pool optimization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Connection pool efficiently manages database connections
- [ ] Health checking prevents use of stale connections
- [ ] Timeout strategies handle network issues gracefully
- [ ] Pool metrics enable performance monitoring
- [ ] Optimization adapts to changing workloads automatically

## Dependencies
- Query optimization (task_046)

## Estimated Time
10 minutes

## Files to Modify/Create
- `src/database/connection_pool.rs` - Connection pool implementation
- `src/database/health_checker.rs` - Connection health monitoring
- `src/database/pool_optimizer.rs` - Pool optimization logic

## Testing Strategy
- Connection pool lifecycle tests
- Health checking accuracy tests
- Performance under load tests
- Optimization algorithm effectiveness tests
