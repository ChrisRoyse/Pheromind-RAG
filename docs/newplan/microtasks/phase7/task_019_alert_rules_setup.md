# Task 019: Alert Rules Setup

## Overview
Configure alerting rules for proactive monitoring and incident detection based on system metrics.

## Objectives
- Define alert conditions and thresholds
- Set up notification channels
- Configure alert severity levels
- Enable alert correlation and grouping

## Requirements
- Alert rules for high latency, error rates, resource usage
- Multiple notification channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty)
- Severity-based escalation
- Alert documentation and runbooks

## Implementation Steps
1. Define alert rule configurations
2. Set up threshold-based conditions
3. Configure notification channels
4. Create alert runbooks
5. Test alert firing and resolution

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Alert rules cover critical system conditions
- [ ] Notifications sent through configured channels
- [ ] Alert severity levels properly configured
- [ ] Runbooks provide clear remediation steps
- [ ] Alert testing confirms functionality

## Dependencies
- Dashboard configuration (task_018)
- Comprehensive metrics collection

## Estimated Time
10 minutes

## Files to Modify/Create
- `config/monitoring/alerts.yml` - Alert rule definitions
- `docs/monitoring/runbooks.md` - Alert runbooks
- `tests/integration/alert_tests.rs` - Alert integration tests

## Testing Strategy
- Alert rule validation tests
- Notification delivery tests
- Threshold accuracy verification
