# Task 027: Correlation IDs

## Overview
Implement correlation ID system for tracking related operations across logs, traces, and services.

## Objectives
- Generate unique correlation IDs for each request
- Propagate correlation IDs across all operations
- Include correlation IDs in all logs and traces
- Enable request flow analysis

## Requirements
- UUID-based correlation ID generation
- HTTP header propagation
- Database and cache operation correlation
- Cross-service correlation maintenance

## Implementation Steps
1. Implement correlation ID generation
2. Add HTTP header propagation middleware
3. Integrate correlation IDs with logging
4. Add database operation correlation
5. Create correlation tracking utilities

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unique correlation IDs generated for each request
- [ ] Correlation IDs propagated via HTTP headers
- [ ] All logs include correlation IDs
- [ ] Database operations tagged with correlation IDs
- [ ] Cross-service correlation maintained

## Dependencies
- Error tracking integration (task_026)
- Structured logging and distributed tracing

## Estimated Time
10 minutes

## Files to Modify/Create
- `src/correlation/id_generator.rs` - Correlation ID generation
- `src/correlation/middleware.rs` - HTTP middleware
- `tests/unit/correlation/correlation_tests.rs` - Unit tests

## Testing Strategy
- ID generation uniqueness tests
- Propagation across service boundaries tests
- Log correlation verification tests
