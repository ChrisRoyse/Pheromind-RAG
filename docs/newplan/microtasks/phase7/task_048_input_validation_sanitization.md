# Task 048: Input Validation and Sanitization

## Overview
Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.

## Objectives
- Validate all user inputs against defined schemas
- Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Implement rate limiting for abuse prevention
- Add audit logging for security events

## Requirements
- Schema-based input validation for all endpoints
- XSS and SQL injection prevention
- File upload security and validation
- Audit logging for validation failures and attacks

## Implementation Steps
1. Implement comprehensive input validation framework
2. Add sanitization for different input types
3. Create file upload security and validation
4. Set up audit logging for security events
5. Add automated security testing and validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All inputs validated against appropriate schemas
- [ ] Sanitization prevents XSS and injection attacks
- [ ] File uploads are secure and properly validated
- [ ] Security events are logged and monitored
- [ ] Automated tests verify security effectiveness

## Dependencies
- Database connection pooling (task_047)

## Estimated Time
10 minutes
