# Task 035: Multi-stage Build Optimization

## Overview
Optimize Docker multi-stage build process to minimize image size and improve build caching efficiency.

## Objectives
- Implement efficient build stage separation
- Optimize layer caching for faster rebuilds
- Minimize final image size
- Improve build reproducibility

## Requirements
- Separate build and runtime stages
- Dependency caching optimization
- Build artifact copying optimization
- Layer ordering for optimal caching

## Implementation Steps
1. Separate dependency installation and compilation stages
2. Optimize layer ordering for cache efficiency
3. Minimize artifacts copied to final stage
4. Add build cache optimization strategies
5. Configure parallel build stages where possible

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Build time reduced through effective caching
- [ ] Final image contains only necessary runtime files
- [ ] Dependency changes don't invalidate entire build
- [ ] Build process is reproducible across environments
- [ ] Multi-stage build reduces image size by >50%

## Dependencies
- Dockerfile creation (task_034)

## Estimated Time
10 minutes

## Files to Modify/Create
- `Dockerfile` - Optimized multi-stage build
- `docker/build.conf` - Build optimization configuration
- `scripts/analyze_build_cache.sh` - Build cache analysis

## Testing Strategy
- Build time measurement tests
- Image size comparison tests
- Cache effectiveness verification
- Reproducibility validation tests
