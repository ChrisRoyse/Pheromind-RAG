# Task 037: Service and Ingress Configuration

## Overview
Configure Kubernetes services and ingress controllers for load balancing, SSL termination, and traffic routing.

## Objectives
- Set up load balancing and service discovery
- Configure SSL/TLS termination
- Implement traffic routing rules
- Enable monitoring and observability

## Requirements
- LoadBalancer or NodePort service types
- SSL certificate management (cert-manager)
- Path-based and host-based routing
- Rate limiting and security headers

## Implementation Steps
1. Configure service types and load balancing
2. Set up SSL certificate management
3. Define ingress routing rules and paths
4. Configure rate limiting and security policies
5. Add monitoring and logging annotations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Service provides stable load balancing
- [ ] SSL certificates automatically provisioned
- [ ] Traffic routes correctly to application pods
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] Monitoring captures service metrics

## Dependencies
- Kubernetes deployment manifests (task_036)

## Estimated Time
10 minutes

## Files to Modify/Create
- `k8s/service.yml` - Enhanced service configuration
- `k8s/ingress.yml` - Complete ingress setup
- `k8s/cert-manager.yml` - Certificate management
- `k8s/network-policies.yml` - Network security policies

## Testing Strategy
- Load balancing distribution tests
- SSL certificate validation tests
- Routing rule verification tests
- Security policy enforcement tests
