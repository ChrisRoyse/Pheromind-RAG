# Task 034: Dockerfile Creation

## Overview
Create optimized Dockerfile for containerizing the application with security and performance best practices.

## Objectives
- Create production-ready Docker image
- Optimize image size and build time
- Implement security best practices
- Support multi-architecture builds

## Requirements
- Multi-stage build for optimization
- Non-root user execution
- Minimal base image (Alpine or distroless)
- Security scanning compatibility

## Implementation Steps
1. Create base Dockerfile with multi-stage build
2. Optimize for minimal image size
3. Configure non-root user execution
4. Add health check and metadata labels
5. Create dockerignore for build optimization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Docker image builds successfully
- [ ] Image size optimized (< 100MB if possible)
- [ ] Runs as non-root user
- [ ] Health check responds correctly
- [ ] Security scan passes without critical issues

## Dependencies
- Client SDK generation (task_033)
- Complete application build system

## Estimated Time
10 minutes

## Files to Modify/Create
- `Dockerfile` - Main Docker image definition
- `.dockerignore` - Build context exclusions
- `scripts/build_docker.sh` - Docker build automation

## Testing Strategy
- Docker build success tests
- Image size optimization verification
- Security scanning validation
- Multi-architecture build tests
