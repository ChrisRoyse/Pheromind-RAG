# Task 036: Kubernetes Deployment Manifests

## Overview
Create comprehensive Kubernetes deployment manifests for production deployment with high availability and scalability.

## Objectives
- Create deployment, service, and ingress manifests
- Configure resource limits and requests
- Implement health checks and readiness probes
- Support horizontal pod autoscaling

## Requirements
- Deployment with replica management
- Service discovery configuration
- Resource quotas and limits
- Liveness and readiness probes

## Implementation Steps
1. Create deployment manifest with resource specifications
2. Define service manifest for internal communication
3. Configure ingress for external access
4. Add health check and probe configurations
5. Create namespace and RBAC configurations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Deployment creates pods successfully
- [ ] Service provides stable internal endpoints
- [ ] Ingress routes external traffic correctly
- [ ] Health probes detect application state accurately
- [ ] Resource limits prevent resource contention

## Dependencies
- Multi-stage build optimization (task_035)

## Estimated Time
10 minutes

## Files to Modify/Create
- `k8s/deployment.yml` - Main deployment manifest
- `k8s/service.yml` - Service configuration
- `k8s/ingress.yml` - Ingress configuration
- `k8s/namespace.yml` - Namespace and RBAC

## Testing Strategy
- Manifest validation tests
- Deployment success verification
- Service connectivity tests
- Health probe functionality tests
