# Task 043: Memory Profiling and Optimization

## Overview
Implement memory profiling to identify memory leaks, optimize allocation patterns, and reduce memory footprint.

## Objectives
- Set up heap and stack memory profiling
- Identify memory leaks and inefficient allocations
- Optimize memory usage patterns
- Monitor memory growth trends

## Requirements
- Memory profiling with allocation tracking
- Heap analysis and leak detection
- Memory optimization recommendations
- Integration with alerting systems

## Implementation Steps
1. Implement memory profiling and tracking
2. Set up heap analysis and visualization
3. Create memory leak detection mechanisms
4. Implement allocation pattern optimization
5. Add memory growth monitoring and alerting

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Memory profiling accurately tracks allocations
- [ ] Heap analysis identifies memory hotspots
- [ ] Leak detection catches memory leaks early
- [ ] Optimization reduces memory footprint by >20%
- [ ] Memory growth alerts prevent OOM conditions

## Dependencies
- CPU profiling with flamegraphs (task_042)

## Estimated Time
10 minutes

## Files to Modify/Create
- `src/profiling/memory_profiler.rs` - Memory profiling implementation
- `src/profiling/heap_analyzer.rs` - Heap analysis logic
- `scripts/analyze_memory_usage.sh` - Memory analysis automation

## Testing Strategy
- Memory tracking accuracy tests
- Leak detection effectiveness tests
- Optimization impact measurement tests
- Alert threshold validation tests
