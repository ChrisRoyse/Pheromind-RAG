# Task 050: Security Headers Configuration

## Overview
Configure comprehensive security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities and enhance client security.

## Objectives
- Implement HTTPS security headers
- Add content security policy (CSP)
- Configure CORS policies appropriately
- Enable security monitoring and reporting

## Requirements
- HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options headers
- Proper CORS configuration for API access
- Security header monitoring and compliance
- Regular security header auditing

## Implementation Steps
1. Configure essential security headers middleware
2. Implement content security policy
3. Set up CORS policies for API endpoints
4. Add security header monitoring and validation
5. Create security header audit and compliance checking

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All essential security headers configured correctly
- [ ] CSP prevents XSS and injection attacks
- [ ] CORS policies allow legitimate access while blocking others
- [ ] Security header compliance is monitored
- [ ] Regular audits ensure headers remain effective

## Dependencies
- Rate limiting implementation (task_049)

## Estimated Time
10 minutes

## Files to Modify/Create
- `src/security/headers.rs` - Security headers configuration
- `src/middleware/security_middleware.rs` - Security headers middleware
- `scripts/audit_security_headers.sh` - Security header audit script

## Testing Strategy
- Security header presence and accuracy tests
- CSP policy effectiveness tests
- CORS policy enforcement tests
- Security audit compliance tests
