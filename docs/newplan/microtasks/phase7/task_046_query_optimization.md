# Task 046: Query Optimization

## Overview
Implement query optimization techniques to reduce search latency and improve query execution efficiency.

## Objectives
- Analyze query patterns and performance
- Implement query planning and optimization
- Add query caching and rewriting strategies
- Optimize for different query types

## Requirements
- Query performance analysis and profiling
- Cost-based query planning and optimization
- Query result caching and invalidation
- Specialized optimizations for different query patterns

## Implementation Steps
1. Implement query performance profiling
2. Create cost-based query planner
3. Add query result caching with smart invalidation
4. Implement query rewriting and optimization rules
5. Add specialized optimizations for common patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Query performance analysis identifies slow queries
- [ ] Query planner reduces execution time by >30%
- [ ] Result caching improves response times significantly
- [ ] Query rewriting optimizes complex queries automatically
- [ ] Specialized optimizations handle edge cases effectively

## Dependencies
- Index optimization strategies (task_045)

## Estimated Time
10 minutes

## Files to Modify/Create
- `src/query/optimizer.rs` - Query optimization engine
- `src/query/planner.rs` - Cost-based query planning
- `src/query/cache.rs` - Query result caching

## Testing Strategy
- Query optimization effectiveness tests
- Query planning accuracy tests
- Cache hit rate and invalidation tests
- Complex query performance tests
