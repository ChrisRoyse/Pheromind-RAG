# Task 016: ML Embedding Dimension Validation Test
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes  
**Phase:** 6 - Testing Reality Check  

## Objective
Validate ML embedding dimensions are consistent and correct across all generated vectors for storage and search.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Verify all embeddings have identical dimensions
- [ ] Test dimension consistency across content types
- [ ] Validate vector storage format compatibility
- [ ] Test dimension handling in vector database
- [ ] Verify no dimension mismatches in operations

## Implementation Steps
1. Generate embeddings for various content samples
2. Verify dimension consistency across all vectors
3. Test storage and retrieval of vectors
4. Validate vector operations (similarity) work
5. Test edge cases: empty content, very long content

## Validation
- All vectors have exactly same dimension count
- Vector storage/retrieval preserves dimensions
- Similarity calculations work with all vectors
- No dimension errors in vector operations
- Edge cases handled gracefully

## Notes
- Document the exact embedding dimensions used
- Test vector format compatibility
- Verify no silent dimension truncation
