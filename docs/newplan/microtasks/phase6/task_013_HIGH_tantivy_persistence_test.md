# Task 013: Tantivy Index Persistence Reality Test
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes  
**Phase:** 6 - Testing Reality Check  

## Objective
Test Tantivy index persistence across application restarts with real data, ensuring durability and consistency.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Create index, restart application, reload successfully
- [ ] Verify search results identical after reload
- [ ] Test index updates and incremental changes
- [ ] Validate index corruption detection/recovery
- [ ] Test concurrent access to persistent index

## Implementation Steps
1. Create and populate index with real corpus
2. Persist index to disk and verify files
3. Restart application and reload index
4. Compare search results before/after restart
5. Test incremental updates to persistent index

## Validation
- Index loads successfully after application restart
- Search results identical before and after reload
- Index files are created and readable
- Updates persist correctly to disk
- No data loss or corruption detected

## Notes
- Test with realistic index sizes
- Verify file system integration works
- Test recovery from incomplete writes
