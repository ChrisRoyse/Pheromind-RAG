# Task 023: Integration Memory Leak Reality Test
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes  
**Phase:** 6 - Testing Reality Check  

## Objective
Test for memory leaks in the complete system under realistic load, ensuring long-running stability.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Run system for extended period with real queries
- [ ] Monitor memory usage over time
- [ ] Test with various query patterns and loads
- [ ] Verify memory usage stabilizes
- [ ] Test garbage collection effectiveness

## Implementation Steps
1. Start system with real corpus loaded
2. Execute queries continuously for 30+ minutes
3. Monitor memory usage patterns
4. Test with different query types and frequencies
5. Force garbage collection and verify cleanup

## Validation
- Memory usage stabilizes after initial loading
- No continuous memory growth detected
- Garbage collection reduces memory usage
- System remains responsive under load
- No out-of-memory errors occur

## Notes
- Monitor all components: BM25, Tantivy, ML model
- Test realistic query patterns and frequencies
- Document memory usage patterns found
