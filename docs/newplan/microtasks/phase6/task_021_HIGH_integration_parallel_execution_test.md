# Task 021: Integration Parallel Execution Test
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes  
**Phase:** 6 - Testing Reality Check  

## Objective
Test parallel execution of multiple search methods with real queries, ensuring concurrency works correctly.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Execute BM25, Tantivy, and ML searches in parallel
- [ ] Test with multiple concurrent queries
- [ ] Verify no race conditions or data corruption
- [ ] Test result merging from parallel executions
- [ ] Validate performance improvement vs sequential

## Implementation Steps
1. Configure parallel execution of search methods
2. Submit multiple queries concurrently
3. Verify all methods execute simultaneously
4. Test result collection and merging
5. Benchmark parallel vs sequential performance

## Validation
- All search methods execute in parallel
- No data races or corruption detected
- Results properly merged from parallel executions
- Performance improvement > 50% vs sequential
- System remains stable under concurrent load

## Notes
- Test with various concurrency levels
- Monitor resource usage during parallel execution
- Verify thread safety of all components
