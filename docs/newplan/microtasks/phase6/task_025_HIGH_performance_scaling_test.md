# Task 025: Performance Scaling Reality Test
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes  
**Phase:** 6 - Testing Reality Check  

## Objective
Test system performance scaling with increasing document counts and concurrent users using real data patterns.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Test scaling from 100 to 10,000+ documents
- [ ] Measure performance degradation curves
- [ ] Test with 1 to 100 concurrent users
- [ ] Validate system stability under peak load
- [ ] Establish scaling limits and bottlenecks

## Implementation Steps
1. Test with progressively larger document corpuses
2. Measure query performance at each scale
3. Test concurrent user simulation
4. Monitor system resources under load
5. Identify performance bottlenecks

## Validation
- Query latency increases sub-linearly with document count
- System handles 50+ concurrent users gracefully
- Memory usage scales predictably
- No system crashes under maximum tested load
- Bottlenecks identified and documented

## Notes
- Use realistic document size and complexity distributions
- Test both search and indexing performance scaling
- Document resource requirements for different scales
