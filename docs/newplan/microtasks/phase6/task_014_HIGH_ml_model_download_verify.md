# Task 014: ML Model Download and Verification Test
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes  
**Phase:** 6 - Testing Reality Check  

## Objective
Download and verify the actual ML embedding model works correctly, ensuring no fake model placeholders.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Download real embedding model (sentence-transformers)
- [ ] Verify model files are valid and complete
- [ ] Test model loading succeeds without errors
- [ ] Validate model architecture matches expectations
- [ ] Test model produces actual embeddings

## Implementation Steps
1. Download specified embedding model from HuggingFace
2. Verify model files integrity and completeness
3. Load model using sentence-transformers library
4. Test model inference with sample text
5. Validate embedding dimensions and format

## Validation
- Model downloads without errors (retry on network issues)
- All required model files present and valid
- Model loads successfully in Python environment
- Generates embeddings with expected dimensions
- No placeholder or mock model behaviors

## Notes
- Test with multiple sentences to verify consistency
- Document exact model version and source
- Verify model works offline after download
