# Task 010: Tantivy Exact Search Real Data Test
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes  
**Phase:** 6 - Testing Reality Check  

## Objective
Test Tantivy exact search functionality with real queries against real indexed codebase content.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Test exact phrase searches with real code snippets
- [ ] Verify case-sensitive and case-insensitive searches
- [ ] Test exact function name matching
- [ ] Validate quoted search queries work correctly
- [ ] Test special character handling in exact searches

## Implementation Steps
1. Execute exact searches for known code patterns
2. Test quoted phrase searches: "async fn main"
3. Verify exact function signatures are found
4. Test edge cases: symbols, punctuation
5. Compare results with manual grep verification

## Validation
- Exact phrase "impl Display for" finds actual implementations
- Quoted searches return only exact matches
- Case sensitivity works as configured
- Special characters in queries don't break search
- Results match manual verification

## Notes
- Test against tokenization edge cases
- Verify exact matching vs fuzzy behavior
- Document any search syntax limitations
