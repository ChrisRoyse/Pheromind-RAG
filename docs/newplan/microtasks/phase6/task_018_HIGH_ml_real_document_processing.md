# Task 018: ML Real Document Processing Test
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes  
**Phase:** 6 - Testing Reality Check  

## Objective
Test ML embedding processing with real documents of various sizes and formats, ensuring robust content handling.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Process real documents from mixed corpus
- [ ] Handle various file formats: .rs, .md, .toml, .json
- [ ] Test with different document sizes (1KB to 1MB+)
- [ ] Verify text extraction and preprocessing works
- [ ] Test memory usage with large documents

## Implementation Steps
1. Load documents from mixed content corpus
2. Test text extraction for each format
3. Generate embeddings for all document types
4. Monitor memory usage during processing
5. Validate embedding quality across formats

## Validation
- All supported formats process successfully
- Large documents handled without memory issues
- Text extraction preserves meaningful content
- Embeddings generated for all processed documents
- No failures or crashes with real content

## Notes
- Test edge cases: empty files, binary content
- Document any format-specific processing issues
- Verify preprocessing steps work correctly
