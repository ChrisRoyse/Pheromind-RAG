# Task 022: Integration Failure Scenario Test
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes  
**Phase:** 6 - Testing Reality Check  

## Objective
Test system behavior when components fail, ensuring graceful degradation and error handling with real failure scenarios.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Test ML model unavailable scenario
- [ ] Test Tantivy index corruption/missing
- [ ] Test network failures for model downloads
- [ ] Verify graceful fallback to available methods
- [ ] Test partial system operation

## Implementation Steps
1. Simulate ML model loading failures
2. Test with corrupted/missing Tantivy index
3. Simulate network issues during operations
4. Test system response to component failures
5. Verify fallback mechanisms work

## Validation
- System continues operating when ML model fails
- BM25 search works when Tantivy is unavailable
- Clear error messages for failure scenarios
- No system crashes from component failures
- Fallback provides reasonable search results

## Notes
- Test realistic failure scenarios
- Document system behavior under failures
- Verify logging and error reporting
