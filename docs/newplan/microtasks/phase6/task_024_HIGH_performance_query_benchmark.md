# Task 024: Performance Query Benchmark Reality Test
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes  
**Phase:** 6 - Testing Reality Check  

## Objective
Benchmark query performance with real data volumes and realistic query patterns to establish production baselines.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Benchmark 1000+ queries with real corpus
- [ ] Measure latency distribution for each search method
- [ ] Test with realistic query complexity mix
- [ ] Establish p50, p95, p99 latency benchmarks
- [ ] Test performance under various loads

## Implementation Steps
1. Prepare realistic query mix from test dataset
2. Execute large batch of queries with timing
3. Measure latency for each search method
4. Test performance scaling with concurrent queries
5. Document performance characteristics

## Validation
- BM25 queries: p95 < 100ms
- Tantivy queries: p95 < 200ms  
- ML semantic queries: p95 < 500ms
- Hybrid queries: p95 < 800ms
- Performance degrades gracefully under load

## Notes
- Test with cold and warm system states
- Document system specifications for benchmarks
- Compare performance across different query types
