# Task 008: BM25 Performance Reality Benchmark
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes  
**Phase:** 6 - Testing Reality Check  

## Objective
Benchmark BM25 search performance with real data volumes and query patterns to establish baseline metrics.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Measure search latency with real corpus (500KB-2MB)
- [ ] Test performance with 1000+ concurrent queries
- [ ] Benchmark index build time with real files
- [ ] Test memory usage under load
- [ ] Establish performance baselines for scaling

## Implementation Steps
1. Build BM25 index with full real corpus
2. Measure single-query latency distribution
3. Test concurrent query performance
4. Profile memory usage during operations
5. Document performance characteristics

## Validation
- Single query latency < 50ms (p95)
- Index build time < 30 seconds for 2MB corpus
- Memory usage < 100MB for test corpus
- 100 concurrent queries complete < 5 seconds
- Performance degrades gracefully with load

## Notes
- Use realistic query patterns and frequencies
- Test both cached and cold query performance
- Document system specifications for benchmarks
