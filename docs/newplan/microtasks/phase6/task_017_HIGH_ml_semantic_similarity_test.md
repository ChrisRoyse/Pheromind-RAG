# Task 017: ML Semantic Similarity Reality Test
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes  
**Phase:** 6 - Testing Reality Check  

## Objective
Test semantic similarity calculations with real code content, verifying meaningful similarity scores and rankings.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Test similarity between related code concepts
- [ ] Verify similar functions score higher than unrelated
- [ ] Test query-document similarity calculations
- [ ] Validate similarity scores are in expected range [0,1]
- [ ] Test similarity ranking quality

## Implementation Steps
1. Generate embeddings for related/unrelated code samples
2. Calculate cosine similarity between embeddings
3. Test query embeddings against document embeddings
4. Verify similarity scores make semantic sense
5. Test similarity-based ranking

## Validation
- Related code has higher similarity than unrelated code
- Similarity scores are between 0 and 1
- Similar functions rank higher in search results
- Query-document similarity drives relevant results
- Semantic relationships captured in similarity

## Notes
- Test with both syntactic and semantic similarity
- Verify cosine similarity implementation is correct
- Document similarity thresholds found effective
