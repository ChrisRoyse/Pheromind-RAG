# Task 011: Tantivy Fuzzy Search Real Code Test
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes  
**Phase:** 6 - Testing Reality Check  

## Objective
Test Tantivy fuzzy search capabilities with real code content, verifying typo tolerance and approximate matching.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Test fuzzy matching with common typos in queries
- [ ] Verify edit distance parameters work correctly
- [ ] Test fuzzy search with function/variable names
- [ ] Validate fuzzy matching doesn't return nonsense results
- [ ] Test performance impact of fuzzy search

## Implementation Steps
1. Create queries with intentional typos
2. Test fuzzy search with real function names
3. Verify edit distance thresholds work
4. Test performance vs exact search
5. Validate result quality and relevance

## Validation
- "asynch" finds "async" related content
- Typos in function names return correct functions
- Edit distance=2 returns reasonable results
- No completely unrelated results in top 10
- Fuzzy search latency < 2x exact search

## Notes
- Test with programming-specific typos
- Balance between tolerance and precision
- Document optimal fuzzy parameters found
