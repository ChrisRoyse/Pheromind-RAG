# Task 019: Full Pipeline Integration Reality Test
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes  
**Phase:** 6 - Testing Reality Check  

## Objective
Test the complete search pipeline end-to-end with real data, ensuring all components integrate correctly.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Execute full pipeline: indexing → search → ranking → results
- [ ] Test with real corpus and real queries
- [ ] Verify BM25, Tantivy, and ML components all work together
- [ ] Test hybrid search combining multiple methods
- [ ] Validate complete search workflow

## Implementation Steps
1. Index real corpus with all search methods
2. Execute real queries through complete pipeline
3. Test hybrid search combining BM25 + ML
4. Verify result merging and ranking works
5. Test pipeline with various query types

## Validation
- Pipeline processes real data without errors
- All search methods contribute to final results
- Hybrid search produces better results than individual methods
- Result ranking combines multiple signals correctly
- Complete workflow completes within reasonable time

## Notes
- Test realistic query load and patterns
- Verify no component failures in integration
- Document pipeline performance characteristics
