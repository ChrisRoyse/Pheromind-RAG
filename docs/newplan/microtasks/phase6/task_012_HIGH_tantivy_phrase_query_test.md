# Task 012: Tantivy Phrase Query Real Content Test
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes  
**Phase:** 6 - Testing Reality Check  

## Objective
Test Tantivy phrase query functionality with real multi-word programming concepts and code patterns.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Test phrase queries with real programming concepts
- [ ] Verify word order matters in phrase searches
- [ ] Test proximity search with slop parameters
- [ ] Validate phrase queries with code syntax
- [ ] Test performance of complex phrase queries

## Implementation Steps
1. Execute phrase queries for programming concepts
2. Test word order sensitivity in results
3. Configure and test proximity search
4. Test phrases containing code syntax
5. Benchmark phrase query performance

## Validation
- "error handling" finds actual error handling code
- Word order affects results appropriately
- Proximity search finds related terms within distance
- Code phrases like "impl Default" work correctly
- Phrase queries complete within reasonable time

## Notes
- Test both natural language and code phrases
- Verify proximity parameters work as expected
- Document optimal phrase query configuration
