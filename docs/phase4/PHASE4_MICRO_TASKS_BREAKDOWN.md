# Phase 4: MCP Server & Tools - Micro Task Breakdown

## Overview
This document breaks down Phase 4 (Tasks 031-040) into 68 atomic micro tasks, each designed to take no more than 15 minutes. The tasks follow TDD (Test-Driven Development) principles using the red-green-refactor strategy.

## Task Organization

### 1. Core MCP Server Setup (Tasks 1-11)
**Purpose**: Establish the basic MCP server foundation
- Tasks 1-3: Project setup and server initialization
- Tasks 4-5: Tool registration system
- Tasks 6-7: Search tool definition
- Tasks 8-11: Search parameter handling

### 2. Search Tool Implementation (Tasks 12-17)
**Purpose**: Complete the search_code tool with 3-chunk context
- Tasks 12-15: Response structures and serialization
- Tasks 16-17: Integration and result conversion

### 3. Clear Database Tool (Tasks 18-23)
**Purpose**: Implement database clearing with confirmation
- Tasks 18-19: Tool definition
- Tasks 20-23: Handler with confirmation logic

### 4. Reindex Tool Implementation (Tasks 24-39)
**Purpose**: Build the reindex_all tool with directory support
- Tasks 24-27: Tool definition and basic handler
- Tasks 28-29: Directory path resolution
- Tasks 30-35: File discovery and filtering
- Tasks 36-39: Progress tracking and completion

### 5. Toggle Watch Tool (Tasks 40-43)
**Purpose**: Control file watching functionality
- Tasks 40-41: Tool definition
- Tasks 42-43: Enable/disable handler

### 6. Request Routing (Tasks 44-47)
**Purpose**: Route MCP requests to appropriate handlers
- Tasks 44-45: Basic router implementation
- Tasks 46-47: Error handling for unknown methods

### 7. Transport Layer (Tasks 48-57)
**Purpose**: Implement stdio transport for MCP protocol
- Tasks 48-49: Transport initialization
- Tasks 50-53: JSON-RPC message handling
- Tasks 54-57: Error handling and async support

### 8. System Integration (Tasks 58-68)
**Purpose**: Complete system integration and testing
- Tasks 58-61: Full system assembly
- Tasks 62-63: Documentation and examples
- Tasks 64-68: Comprehensive testing and validation

## TDD Approach

Each feature follows this pattern:

1. **Red Phase** (Test First)
   - Write a failing test that defines the expected behavior
   - Run the test to ensure it fails for the right reason

2. **Green Phase** (Make it Pass)
   - Write the minimal code needed to pass the test
   - Focus on functionality, not optimization

3. **Refactor Phase** (Clean Up)
   - Improve code structure while keeping tests green
   - Remove duplication and improve readability

## Example Task Flow

**Task 2**: Write failing test for MCP server initialization
```rust
#[test]
fn test_mcp_server_new() {
    let server = MCPServer::new(PathBuf::from("/test/path"));
    assert!(server.is_ok());
}
```

**Task 3**: Implement minimal MCPServer struct
```rust
pub struct MCPServer {
    project_path: PathBuf,
}

impl MCPServer {
    pub fn new(project_path: PathBuf) -> Result<Self> {
        Ok(Self { project_path })
    }
}
```

## Success Criteria

When all 68 tasks are completed:

1. **Functional Requirements Met**
   - All 4 MCP tools working correctly
   - 3-chunk context always returned in searches
   - Proper confirmation for destructive operations
   - Directory parameter support for reindexing

2. **Performance Requirements Met**
   - <1s response time for all tools
   - <500ms search latency
   - <2GB memory usage

3. **Quality Requirements Met**
   - 100% test coverage for critical paths
   - Graceful error handling
   - Clear documentation
   - Example usage scripts

## Dependencies

- Phase 1-3 must be completed before starting Phase 4
- Tasks within each section should generally be done in order
- Integration tests require all components to be implemented

## Estimated Timeline

With 68 tasks at ~15 minutes each:
- Total estimated time: 17 hours
- With overhead and integration: ~20-24 hours
- Recommended schedule: 3-4 days of focused work

## Key Testing Considerations

1. **Unit Tests**: Each component tested in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Components working together
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Full MCP protocol flow
4. **Performance Tests**: Response time validation
5. **Error Tests**: Graceful failure handling

## Risk Mitigation

- Start with core functionality (search tool)
- Test each component thoroughly before integration
- Use mock objects for external dependencies
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Document assumptions and limitations
