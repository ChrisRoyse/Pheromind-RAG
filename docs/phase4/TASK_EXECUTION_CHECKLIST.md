## Parallel Execution Opportunities

The following stages can be worked on in parallel after Stage 1:
- Stage 3 (Search Response) 
- Stage 4 (Clear Database)
- Stage 5-6 (Reindex Tool)
- Stage 7 (Toggle Watch)

These must be completed before:
- Stage 8 (Request Routing) 
- Stage 9 (Transport Layer)
- Stage 10 (Final Integration)

## Daily Progress Tracking

### Day 1 (6 hours)
- [ ] Complete Stages 1-3 (Tasks 1-17)
- [ ] Start Stage 4 (Tasks 18-20)

### Day 2 (6 hours)  
- [ ] Complete Stage 4 (Tasks 21-23)
- [ ] Complete Stages 5-6 (Tasks 24-39)

### Day 3 (6 hours)
- [ ] Complete Stage 7 (Tasks 40-43)
- [ ] Complete Stage 8 (Tasks 44-47)
- [ ] Complete Stage 9 (Tasks 48-57)

### Day 4 (5 hours)
- [ ] Complete Stage 10 (Tasks 58-68)
- [ ] Final testing and documentation review

## Quality Gates

Before moving to the next stage:
1. All tests in current stage must pass
2. Code coverage >80% for new code
3. No compiler warnings
4. Documentation updated

Before final completion:
1. All 4 tools tested end-to-end
2. Performance benchmarks met (<1s response)
3. Memory usage validated (<2GB)
4. Error scenarios tested
5. Documentation complete

## Risk Mitigation

If falling behind schedule:
1. Prioritize search tool (most important)
2. Simplify reindex progress reporting
3. Use basic stdio transport initially
4. Defer advanced error handling

Critical path (must have):
- Tasks 1-17 (Search tool)
- Tasks 44-47 (Basic routing)
- Tasks 48-53 (Basic transport)
- Tasks 58-61 (Integration)
