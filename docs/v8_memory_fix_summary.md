# V8 Memory Crash Fix Summary

## Problem
The MCP server was crashing with a V8 fatal error when attempting to load the Nomic embedding model:
```
FATAL ERROR: v8::ToLocalChecked Empty MaybeLocal
```

This occurred because:
1. The MCP server runs in Node.js environment via `npx claude-flow@alpha mcp start`
2. The ~80MB GGUF model file was being memory-mapped and fully loaded into RAM during initialization
3. Node.js has default heap size limits (~2GB) that were exceeded during tensor dequantization
4. Multiple large tensors were being loaded simultaneously without memory management

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Lazy Loading for Embeddings
- Created `LazyEmbedder` wrapper that delays model initialization until first use
- Prevents memory allocation during server startup
- Only loads the model when embeddings are actually needed

### 2. Memory-Safe Initialization
- Modified `UnifiedSearcher` to use lazy embedder instead of eager initialization
- Added async methods for embedding operations
- Improved error handling for memory allocation failures

### 3. Node.js Memory Configuration
- Created startup scripts with proper `NODE_OPTIONS` configuration
- Set heap size to 4GB: `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096`
- Scripts available for both Windows (.bat) and Unix (.sh)

### 4. Memory Monitoring
- Added `MemoryMonitor` utility for tracking memory usage
- Configurable thresholds and warnings
- RAII guards for automatic memory tracking

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- Added CPU yielding during tensor loading to prevent blocking
- Improved memory mapping with pre-fault pages
- Better progress reporting during model loading

## Usage

### Starting the MCP Server with Memory Fix

**Windows:**
```batch
scripts\start-mcp-server.bat
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/start-mcp-server.sh
./scripts/start-mcp-server.sh
```

### Or manually set Node options:
```bash
# Windows
set NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096
npx claude-flow@alpha mcp start

# Linux/Mac
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"
npx claude-flow@alpha mcp start
```

## Files Modified

1. **New Files:**
   - `src/embedding/lazy_embedder.rs` - Lazy loading wrapper
   - `src/utils/memory_monitor.rs` - Memory monitoring utilities
   - `scripts/start-mcp-server.bat` - Windows startup script
   - `scripts/start-mcp-server.sh` - Unix startup script

2. **Modified Files:**
   - `src/embedding/mod.rs` - Export lazy embedder
   - `src/search/unified.rs` - Use lazy embedder
   - `src/embedding/nomic.rs` - Add CPU yielding
   - `src/utils/mod.rs` - Export memory utilities

## Benefits

1. **No more V8 crashes** - Model loading is deferred and memory-safe
2. **Faster startup** - Server starts immediately without loading models
3. **Better resource usage** - Models only loaded when needed
4. **Configurable memory** - Easy to adjust heap size as needed
5. **Monitoring** - Can track memory usage and prevent OOM conditions

## Testing

The fix has been implemented but requires testing with:
1. Starting the MCP server using the new scripts
2. Verifying lazy loading works correctly
3. Testing embedding operations still function
4. Monitoring memory usage during operation

## Future Improvements

1. Consider streaming tensor loading for even lower memory usage
2. Implement model quantization to reduce memory footprint
3. Add automatic memory limit detection based on system resources
4. Consider using WebAssembly for better memory isolation
