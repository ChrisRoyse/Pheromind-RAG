## Performance Metrics to Track

### During Development
- [ ] Search latency: <500ms
- [ ] Memory usage: <2GB
- [ ] Startup time: <30s
- [ ] Reindex speed: >100 files/sec

### Final Validation
- [ ] 85% search accuracy achieved
- [ ] All 4 MCP tools functional
- [ ] Concurrent request handling working
- [ ] Error recovery tested
- [ ] Git watching reliable

## Integration Points to Verify

### Component Connections
- [ ] Storage ↔ Searcher
- [ ] Embedder ↔ Storage
- [ ] GitWatcher ↔ Updater
- [ ] Server ↔ Transport
- [ ] Router ↔ Handlers

### External Interfaces
- [ ] MCP protocol compliance
- [ ] JSON-RPC formatting
- [ ] Stdio communication
- [ ] LLM compatibility

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Lock contention | Use try_read/try_write with timeout |
| Memory spike | Batch file processing |
| Slow searches | Check index corruption |
| Git watch fails | Verify git status works |
| Transport errors | Validate JSON format |

## Final Deliverable Requirements

1. **Executable binary** that starts MCP server
2. **4 working tools** via MCP protocol
3. **<500ms search** with 3-chunk context
4. **Git-based updates** working reliably
5. **Complete docs** for LLM integration
