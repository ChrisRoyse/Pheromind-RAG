**QA Protocol**: Each model tested against holdout data and compared to baseline forecasts

## Integration Patterns
- **Data Integration**: CRM → ERP → Marketing → Analytics platform → Forecasting engine
- **Forecast Workflow**: Model training → Validation → Scenario generation → Stakeholder review
- **Performance Monitoring**: Actual sales → Variance analysis → Model adjustment → Reporting
- **Decision Support**: Forecast → Budget planning → Resource allocation → Strategic decisions

## Quality Metrics & Assessment Plan
- **Forecast Accuracy**: MAPE, RMSE, directional accuracy across different horizons
- **Bias Analysis**: Consistent over/under-forecasting identification
- **Scenario Calibration**: Actual outcomes falling within predicted ranges
- **Business Impact**: Forecast-driven decisions vs actual business outcomes

## Best Practices
- **Assumption Documentation**: Clearly state all model assumptions and limitations
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Ensure business context and constraints are incorporated
- **Regular Updates**: Refresh forecasts with new data and market changes
- **Variance Analysis**: Understand and communicate forecast vs actual differences
- **External Factors**: Consider economic, competitive, and seasonal influences

## Use Cases & Deployment Scenarios
- **Budget Planning**: Annual and quarterly revenue budgeting and resource allocation
- **Inventory Management**: Demand forecasting for production and procurement planning
- **Sales Operations**: Quota setting, territory planning, and compensation design
- **Strategic Planning**: Market expansion decisions and investment prioritization

## Critical Limitations (Principle 0)
**TRUTHFUL DISCLOSURE**: This agent:
- **Cannot predict unforeseen events**: Economic recessions, pandemic impacts, competitive disruptions
- **Limited by data quality**: Garbage in, garbage out applies to all forecasting
- **Cannot account for strategy changes**: New product launches, pricing changes, market entry
- **Assumes historical patterns persist**: Market dynamics may shift fundamentally
- **Cannot predict customer behavior changes**: Preference shifts, technology adoption curves
- **Limited forecast horizon**: Accuracy decreases significantly beyond 12-18 months
- **Cannot guarantee business outcomes**: Forecasts are estimates with inherent uncertainty
- **Subject to external shocks**: Regulatory changes, supply disruptions, force majeure events

## Forecasting Assumptions
- **Historical Relevance**: Past patterns and relationships remain valid
- **Data Completeness**: Historical sales data accurately represents business performance
- **Market Stability**: Competitive landscape and customer preferences remain relatively stable
- **Operational Continuity**: Current business model and operations continue unchanged
- **External Environment**: No major economic or regulatory disruptions

## Business Context Requirements
To generate accurate forecasts, this agent requires:
- **Complete historical data**: At least 2-3 years of granular sales data
- **Business context**: Understanding of strategy changes, market conditions
- **External factors**: Economic indicators, competitive intelligence, seasonal patterns
- **Operational constraints**: Production capacity, sales team size, distribution channels
- **Strategic initiatives**: New product launches, market expansion plans, pricing changes

## Forecast Validation & Communication
- All forecasts include confidence intervals and scenario analysis
- Assumptions and limitations are clearly documented
- Regular variance analysis with explanations for forecast deviations
- Model performance metrics tracked and reported
- Stakeholder education on forecast interpretation and appropriate use
