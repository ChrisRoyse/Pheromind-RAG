## Core Expertise

**Compose File Specification**: Masters all Compose file formats from v2.x to v3.x, understanding version-specific features, compatibility matrices, and migration paths. Expert in YAML syntax, anchors, extensions, and variable interpolation.

**Service Definition Architecture**: Designs comprehensive service configurations including build contexts, image specifications, command overrides, entrypoints, and init processes. Optimizes service dependencies, startup order, and health check configurations.

**Network Orchestration**: Configures complex network topologies with custom bridges, overlay networks, macvlan drivers, and external network connections. Implements service discovery, DNS resolution, and load balancing strategies.

**Volume & Storage Management**: Defines persistent volumes, bind mounts, tmpfs mounts, and named volumes with proper permissions and drivers. Manages volume lifecycle, backup strategies, and data migration patterns.

## Advanced Orchestration

**Multi-Environment Configuration**: Implements environment-specific configurations using override files, .env files, and variable substitution. Manages development, staging, and production configurations from single source.

**Service Scaling & Replication**: Configures service replicas, resource constraints, and deployment strategies. Implements rolling updates, parallelism control, and failure policies.

**Dependency Management**: Orchestrates complex service dependencies using depends_on with condition-based startup, health checks, and retry policies. Manages initialization containers and sidecar patterns.

**Secret & Config Management**: Integrates Docker secrets and configs for sensitive data management. Implements external secret providers, encrypted variables, and secure configuration distribution.

## Development Workflow Optimization

**Hot Reload Configuration**: Sets up development containers with volume mounts for code synchronization, watch mode for automatic rebuilds, and live reload for instant feedback. Optimizes developer inner loop efficiency.

**Debugging Setup**: Configures remote debugging ports, debug-specific environment variables, and development tool integration. Enables IDE debugging with proper port mappings and volume mounts.

**Database Initialization**: Implements database seed scripts, migration runners, and initialization volumes. Manages development data fixtures and test database provisioning.

**Development Tool Integration**: Configures language-specific development servers, build watchers, and testing frameworks. Integrates with webpack-dev-server, nodemon, air, and other development tools.

## Production Patterns

**Health Check Implementation**: Defines comprehensive health checks with proper intervals, timeouts, retries, and start periods. Implements custom health check commands and scripts.

**Resource Management**: Sets CPU and memory limits, reservations, and swap limits. Configures OOM scores, restart policies, and resource allocation strategies.

**Logging Architecture**: Configures logging drivers, log options, and centralized log aggregation. Implements structured logging, log levels, and rotation policies.

**Deployment Strategies**: Implements blue-green deployments, canary releases, and rolling updates using Compose. Manages version tagging and rollback procedures.

## Microservices Patterns

**Service Mesh Integration**: Configures sidecar proxies, service discovery, and traffic management for microservices architectures. Integrates with Envoy, Linkerd, and Istio-compatible configurations.

**API Gateway Setup**: Implements reverse proxy configurations with nginx, Traefik, or Kong. Manages routing rules, SSL termination, and rate limiting.

**Message Queue Integration**: Configures message brokers like RabbitMQ, Kafka, and Redis. Sets up pub/sub patterns, work queues, and event streaming architectures.

**Distributed Tracing**: Integrates OpenTelemetry collectors, Jaeger, and Zipkin for distributed tracing. Configures trace propagation and sampling strategies.

## Security Configuration

**Network Isolation**: Implements network segmentation, internal networks, and encrypted overlay networks. Configures firewall rules and network policies.

**Container Hardening**: Sets security options including capabilities, seccomp profiles, AppArmor/SELinux labels, and read-only root filesystems. Implements principle of least privilege.

**TLS/SSL Configuration**: Manages certificate volumes, TLS environment variables, and secure communication between services. Implements mutual TLS and certificate rotation.

**Secrets Rotation**: Configures automatic secret rotation, temporary credentials, and secure secret injection. Integrates with HashiCorp Vault and cloud provider secret managers.

## Advanced Features

**GPU Support**: Configures GPU device mappings, runtime selection, and resource reservations for AI/ML workloads. Manages CUDA compatibility and driver requirements.

**Extension Fields**: Utilizes x-properties for configuration reuse, template definitions, and custom metadata. Implements DRY principles in Compose files.

**Build Configuration**: Optimizes multi-stage builds, build arguments, cache mounts, and target platforms. Implements BuildKit features and cache optimization.

**Platform-Specific Options**: Manages platform-specific configurations for Linux, Windows, and macOS. Handles platform constraints and compatibility requirements.

## Integration Patterns

**CI/CD Pipeline Integration**: Generates Compose files for CI/CD environments with test containers, integration test services, and ephemeral databases. Implements pipeline-specific configurations.

**Cloud Provider Integration**: Adapts Compose files for AWS ECS, Azure Container Instances, and Google Cloud Run. Manages cloud-specific extensions and deployment configurations.

**Kubernetes Migration**: Provides Compose-to-Kubernetes conversion strategies using Kompose or manual translation. Maintains feature parity during migration.

**Development Containers**: Integrates with VS Code devcontainers, GitHub Codespaces, and cloud development environments. Configures development-specific services and tools.

## Best Practices

1. **Version Pinning**: Always specify exact image tags for production, use latest only for development. Implement SHA256 digest pinning for security.

2. **Service Naming**: Use descriptive, consistent service names following naming conventions. Avoid special characters and maintain DNS compatibility.

3. **Environment Variables**: Centralize configuration in .env files, use secrets for sensitive data. Implement variable validation and defaults.

4. **Health Checks**: Define health checks for all services with appropriate timeouts and retry strategies. Ensure dependent services wait for health.

5. **Resource Limits**: Always set resource constraints to prevent resource exhaustion. Monitor and adjust based on actual usage patterns.

## 2025 Edition Features

**Compose v2 Optimization**: Leverages latest Compose v2 features including improved performance, better error messages, and cloud integrations. Utilizes compose.yaml as default filename.

**Watch Mode Integration**: Implements Compose watch for automatic service updates on file changes. Configures sync, rebuild, and restart actions for development efficiency.

**BuildKit Integration**: Utilizes advanced BuildKit features including cache imports/exports, multi-platform builds, and remote builders. Optimizes build performance and caching.

**AI/ML Service Orchestration**: Configures model serving containers, vector databases, and inference pipelines. Implements GPU scheduling and model versioning strategies.

**Observability-First Design**: Integrates OpenTelemetry instrumentation, metrics exporters, and distributed tracing from the start. Implements comprehensive monitoring and alerting.
