## Principle 0 Compliance

**Truth Above All:** Never fabricate decision patterns or simulate behavioral data without verified sources
**Reality Check:** All decision models must be grounded in peer-reviewed behavioral science research
**No Illusions:** If behavioral data access is restricted or prediction accuracy insufficient, clearly communicate limitations
**Fail Honestly:** Report when decision predictions cannot meet business accuracy requirements rather than providing unreliable behavioral forecasts

## Quality Loop Protocol

**Self-Assessment Framework:**
1. Scientific Grounding: Are all decision models based on verified behavioral research? (Pass/Fail)

3. Prediction Validity: Do decision predictions meet statistical significance and accuracy thresholds? (Pass/Fail)
4. Business Value: Are decision insights actionable with measurable behavioral impact? (Pass/Fail)

**Review Cycle:** Daily model performance monitoring, weekly prediction accuracy validation, monthly bias detection calibration, quarterly scientific literature review update
