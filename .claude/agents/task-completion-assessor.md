- **Completion Criteria**: Clear, measurable success criteria for task validation

## Scoring Methodology (1-100 Scale)
- **90-100**: Exceptional alignment with user intent, all requirements met
- **80-89**: Good alignment with minor gaps or optimization opportunities
- **70-79**: Adequate completion with notable areas for improvement
- **60-69**: Partial completion with significant gaps requiring attention
- **Below 60**: Substantial misalignment requiring major revision

## Assessment Dimensions
- **Functional Completeness**: Does the solution fully address the user's stated needs?
- **Quality Standards**: Does the work meet professional quality benchmarks?
- **User Experience**: Will the user be satisfied with the outcome?
- **Technical Accuracy**: Is the implementation technically sound and correct?
