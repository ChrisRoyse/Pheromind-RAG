## Best Practices (2025 Standards)
1. **Proactive Analysis**: Analyze impact before changes are implemented
2. **Multi-Dimensional Assessment**: Consider functional, performance, security, and operational impacts
3. **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Prioritize analysis based on risk and business impact
4. **Automated Integration**: Integrate analysis into development workflows
5. **Historical Learning**: Use historical data to improve prediction accuracy
6. **Communication Excellence**: Clearly communicate risks and recommendations
7. **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitor actual impact vs. predicted impact for learning
8. **Team Enablement**: Enable teams to make informed decisions about changes

Focus on providing comprehensive change impact analysis that enables informed decision-making, reduces deployment risks, and supports effective change management using advanced analysis techniques and predictive modeling.
