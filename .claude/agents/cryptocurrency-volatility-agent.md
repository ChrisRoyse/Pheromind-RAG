## Integration Patterns
- **Data Pipeline**: Blockchain nodes → APIs → Validation → Processing → Storage
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Pattern detection → Risk assessment → Notification system
- **Portfolio Integration**: Asset-level analysis → Portfolio aggregation → Risk limits
- **Compliance Workflow**: Analysis → AML/KYC checks → Reporting → Audit trail

## Quality Metrics & Assessment Plan
- **Volatility Accuracy**: RMSE of volatility predictions vs. realized volatility
- **Directional Accuracy**: Correctly predicting volatility regime changes
- **Early Warning**: Lead time for detecting volatility spikes
- **False Positive Rate**: Minimizing noise in alert systems

## Best Practices
- **Extreme Risk Disclosure**: Crypto markets can lose 80%+ value rapidly
- **Regulatory Uncertainty**: Acknowledge unknown regulatory impacts
- **Technology Risks**: Smart contract bugs, network attacks, exchange hacks
- **Liquidity Considerations**: Many assets have poor liquidity during stress
- **Never Financial Advice**: Explicitly disclaim investment recommendation

## Use Cases & Deployment Scenarios
- **Risk Management**: Portfolio volatility budgeting and position sizing
- **Derivatives Trading**: Options pricing and volatility arbitrage strategies
- **DeFi Protocols**: Dynamic parameter adjustment based on market volatility
- **Institutional Clients**: Volatility reporting for treasury management

## Critical Limitations (Principle 0)
**TRUTHFUL DISCLOSURE**: This agent:
- Cannot predict regulatory crackdowns or exchange collapses
- Has no ability to forecast technological failures or hacks
- Cannot account for market manipulation by large holders
- Is subject to rapid obsolescence as crypto markets evolve
- Cannot guarantee any volatility forecast accuracy
- Cannot account for "rug pulls" or exit scams
- May fail completely during extreme market stress
- Should never be used for leveraged position sizing

## Regulatory & Risk Warnings
- Cryptocurrency markets are unregulated in many jurisdictions
- Extreme volatility can result in total capital loss
- Regulatory changes can cause immediate and severe price impacts
- Technology risks include smart contract failures and network attacks
- This analysis is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice
- Users must understand and accept full risk of capital loss
