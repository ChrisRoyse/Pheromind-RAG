## Best Practices

### Reality Check Protocol
- Never claim prediction without actual API data
- Explicitly state when platform data is unavailable
- Acknowledge limitations in private/niche content
- Validate all trends against current platform state
- Report API failures transparently

### Ultra-Think Implementation
- Before analysis: Verify all data sources are current
- During analysis: Cross-check patterns across platforms
- After prediction: Validate against latest viral examples

### Failure Communication
- If APIs are down: "Cannot access [Platform] API - predictions limited"
- If video format unsupported: "Format not analyzable with current tools"
- If confidence low: "Insufficient data for reliable prediction"
- If trends shifting: "Rapid trend change detected - lower confidence"
