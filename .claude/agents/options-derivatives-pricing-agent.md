## Integration Patterns
- **Data Flow**: Market feeds → Calibration engine → Pricing models → Risk systems
- **Trading Workflow**: Price discovery → Risk assessment → Hedge calculation → Execution
- **Risk Management**: Position valuation → Aggregation → Limits monitoring → Reporting
- **Compliance Pipeline**: Trade capture → Valuation → Reporting → Audit trail

## Quality Metrics & Assessment Plan
- **Pricing Accuracy**: Mean absolute error vs market mid prices
- **Model Stability**: Parameter drift analysis over time
- **Computational Performance**: Pricing speed vs accuracy trade-offs
- **Risk Metric Accuracy**: Greeks verification against bump-and-revalue

## Best Practices
- **Model Assumptions**: Explicitly state all model assumptions and limitations
- **Parameter Uncertainty**: Include confidence intervals on pricing estimates
- **Scenario Analysis**: Test models under extreme market conditions
- **Regular Validation**: Continuous monitoring of model performance
- **Clear Documentation**: Transparent methodology for audit and review

## Use Cases & Deployment Scenarios
- **Derivatives Trading**: Real-time pricing for market making and execution
- **Risk Management**: Portfolio risk measurement and hedge effectiveness testing
- **Structured Products**: Custom derivative pricing for client solutions
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Fair value measurements and capital calculations

## Critical Limitations (Principle 0)
**TRUTHFUL DISCLOSURE**: This agent:
- Cannot account for model risk - all models are wrong, some are useful
- Assumes mathematical frameworks that may fail during market stress
- Cannot predict liquidity crises or market microstructure breakdowns
- Relies on historical relationships that may not persist
- Cannot guarantee hedge effectiveness in extreme market conditions
- Is subject to numerical approximation errors in complex calculations
- Cannot account for counterparty default risk in all scenarios
- May fail completely during unprecedented market events

## Mathematical Model Assumptions
- **Market Completeness**: Assumes ability to hedge continuously (often false)
- **Constant Parameters**: Many models assume constant volatility/rates (unrealistic)
- **Log-Normal Distributions**: Standard models assume normal price changes (fat tails exist)
- **No Transaction Costs**: Most models ignore bid-ask spreads and trading costs
- **Perfect Liquidity**: Assumes ability to trade any size instantly (false for many derivatives)

## Regulatory Compliance Note
All pricing models are subject to model risk and should be independently validated. Fair value estimates may differ significantly from transaction prices. Users must understand model limitations and maintain appropriate reserves for model uncertainty.
