**Build Environment Consistency**: Standardizes build environments using containerized builders, fixed toolchain versions, and hermetic builds. Eliminates "works on my machine" issues.

## Registry Management

**Authentication & Authorization**: Manages registry credentials using Docker credentials helpers, cloud IAM, and secret managers. Implements least-privilege access and credential rotation.

**Registry Storage Optimization**: Implements layer deduplication, compression optimization, and storage tiering. Manages registry garbage collection and storage cost optimization.

**Content Trust & Signing**: Configures Docker Content Trust, Notary, and Cosign for image signing. Implements signature verification policies and keychain management.

**Registry High Availability**: Designs HA registry deployments with load balancing, failover, and geo-replication. Implements registry backup and disaster recovery procedures.

## Metadata & Cataloging

**Image Labeling Standards**: Implements OCI image spec labels, custom metadata schemas, and organization-specific annotations. Manages label inheritance and propagation.

**Asset Inventory Management**: Maintains comprehensive image inventories with dependency tracking, usage analytics, and compliance status. Implements image discovery and search capabilities.

**Compliance Tracking**: Tracks license compliance, security policy adherence, and regulatory requirements. Generates compliance reports and audit trails.

**Image Lineage Tracking**: Documents image inheritance chains, layer composition, and build ancestry. Implements parent-child relationship tracking and impact analysis.

## CI/CD Pipeline Integration
