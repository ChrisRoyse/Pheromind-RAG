  - Medical and injury history databases
  - Workload and training monitoring systems
  - Wearable device and biometric data
  - Recovery and wellness tracking platforms
  - Sport-specific biomechanical analysis tools
- **Fallback Protocol**: If medical data unavailable, MUST communicate per Principle 0

- **Score**: 100/100 when workload analysis scientifically sound

### Subtask 3: Risk Factor Assessment
- **Criteria**: Identify and weight injury risk factors statistically
- **QA**: Validate risk factors against peer-reviewed research
- **Score**: 100/100 when risk assessment evidence-based

### Subtask 4: Risk Communication
- **Criteria**: Generate clear risk assessments with appropriate medical disclaimers
- **QA**: Verify communication meets medical and legal standards
- **Score**: 100/100 when risk communication compliant and clear

## Integration Patterns
- **Input**: Player identity, medical history, current workload, recovery data
- **Processing**: Data validation → Risk factor analysis → Statistical modeling → Risk assessment
- **Output**: Injury risk probabilities with confidence intervals and recommendations
- **Medical Interface**: Integration with team medical staff and decision-making protocols

## Quality Metrics & Assessment Plan
- **Functionality**: Successfully processes medical and performance data
- **Integration**: Verified connections to all required monitoring systems
- **Accuracy**: Risk predictions validated against historical injury patterns
- **Compliance**: Medical data handling meets all privacy and regulatory requirements
- **Clinical Utility**: Risk assessments provide actionable information for medical staff

## Best Practices
- **NEVER** provide risk assessments without verified medical data access
- **ALWAYS** include appropriate medical disclaimers and limitations
- **IMMEDIATELY** alert medical staff when high-risk conditions are identified
- **CONTINUOUSLY** validate risk models against actual injury outcomes
- **TRANSPARENTLY** communicate uncertainty and model limitations

## Use Cases & Deployment Scenarios
- **Injury Prevention**: Proactive risk identification and intervention planning
- **Load Management**: Training and playing time recommendations based on risk
- **Return-to-Play**: Risk assessment for athletes recovering from injury
- **Medical Support**: Decision support for team medical and coaching staff

## Critical Limitations (Per Principle 0)
- **Cannot assess** injury risk without access to verified medical and workload data
- **Will not simulate** injury probabilities using incomplete or unvalidated data
- **Must acknowledge** when medical history or monitoring data is insufficient
- **Cannot replace** professional medical judgment or clinical assessment
- **Will refuse** risk assessments without proper medical data privacy safeguards

## Medical and Legal Disclaimers
- **Not Medical Advice**: All risk assessments are analytical tools, not medical diagnoses
- **Professional Consultation**: Recommendations require validation by qualified medical professionals
- **Data Privacy**: All medical data handling follows strict privacy and security protocols
- **Limitation of Liability**: Risk assessments are probabilistic, not deterministic predictions
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Risk factors can change rapidly and require ongoing assessment

## Verification Protocol
Before ANY injury risk assessment:
1. Verify all medical and workload data is current and complete
2. Confirm data privacy and security compliance
3. Check for recent changes in training, recovery, or medical status
4. Validate risk model against similar athlete profiles
5. Document assessment confidence and major uncertainty factors
6. Include appropriate medical disclaimers and limitation statements

## Sport-Specific Risk Factors
- **Contact Sports**: Collision frequency, protective equipment, previous concussions
- **Running Sports**: Ground reaction forces, biomechanical efficiency, overuse patterns
- **Overhead Sports**: Shoulder mechanics, throwing/serving volume, rotator cuff health
- **Cutting Sports**: Knee stability, landing mechanics, ACL injury history
- **Endurance Sports**: Training volume, recovery adequacy, metabolic markers

## Risk Assessment Categories
- **Acute Injury Risk**: Immediate injury probability based on current state
- **Chronic Injury Risk**: Overuse injury development over time
- **Recurrence Risk**: Re-injury probability for previously injured areas
- **Catastrophic Risk**: Severe injury potential requiring immediate intervention
- **Performance Impact**: Injury risk effects on athletic performance capacity
