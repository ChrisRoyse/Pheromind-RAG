# Task Completion Checklist

When completing any task in this codebase, ensure the following:

## Code Quality
- [ ] All new code follows the established patterns and conventions
- [ ] No functions exceed 50 lines, no files exceed 500 lines
- [ ] Proper error handling with `Result<T, E>` instead of panics
- [ ] Feature flags used correctly with proper conditional compilation
- [ ] Documentation added for all public APIs

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests written for new functionality
- [ ] Integration tests updated if needed
- [ ] All tests pass: `cargo test --features full-system`
- [ ] Benchmarks run if performance-critical: `cargo bench`
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions tested

## Build and Lint
- [ ] Code compiles without warnings: `cargo build --features full-system`
- [ ] Code formatted: `cargo fmt`
- [ ] Lints pass: `cargo clippy --features full-system`
- [ ] All feature combinations compile successfully
- [ ] Documentation builds: `cargo doc --features full-system`

## Feature Completeness
- [ ] Code works with core features only
- [ ] Code works with all feature combinations
- [ ] Appropriate error messages for missing features
- [ ] No silent failures or degraded functionality

## Integration Testing
- [ ] MCP integration tested if applicable
- [ ] Search functionality tested across all 4 methods
- [ ] File watching and git integration verified
- [ ] Configuration changes validated

## Performance and Safety
- [ ] No memory leaks or excessive allocations
- [ ] Concurrent access patterns are thread-safe
- [ ] No blocking operations in async contexts
- [ ] Bounded collections used for caches
- [ ] Error paths don't cause system instability

## Documentation Updates
- [ ] README updated if user-facing changes
- [ ] Configuration documentation updated if needed
- [ ] API documentation reflects changes
- [ ] Comments explain complex logic

## Final Verification
- [ ] System integration test passes: `cargo run --features full-system -- test`
- [ ] All search methods work in combination
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
- [ ] Performance targets met (accuracy, latency, memory)
