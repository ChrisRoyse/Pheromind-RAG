## Footnote Definitions

[^1]: This is the first footnote. It contains basic information about footnotes and their purpose in markdown documents. Footnotes are used to provide additional information without cluttering the main text.

[^2]: The second footnote discusses the implementation details of footnote parsing in markdown processors. Most processors use a two-pass approach: first collecting footnote definitions, then resolving references.

[^3]: Cross-references in footnotes create complex dependency graphs that can challenge parsing systems. This footnote references footnote [^1] and footnote [^4] to demonstrate this complexity.

[^4]: Basic concepts in markdown include headers, paragraphs, lists, links, and emphasis. This footnote provides foundational knowledge referenced by other footnotes.

[^5]: Terminology footnote: **Markdown** is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. **Parser** is a program that analyzes text according to grammar rules. **Renderer** converts parsed markdown to output format.

[^6]: Complex footnotes may contain multiple paragraphs, code blocks, lists, and other markdown elements.

    ```python
    def process_footnote(content):
        return parse_markdown(content)
    ```
    
    This code example shows how footnotes can contain code blocks.

[^7]: Nested information in footnotes creates hierarchical structures. This footnote contains:
    - Primary information
    - Secondary details  
    - Tertiary explanations
    
    Each level adds depth to the documentation.

[^8]: Multi-paragraph footnotes test the parser's ability to handle complex content within footnote definitions.
