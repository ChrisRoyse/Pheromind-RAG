# Binary Data Disguised as Text - Ultimate Parser Breaker 💥

This file contains binary data that appears to be text but contains embedded null bytes, 
control characters, and malformed UTF-8 sequences designed to break text processors.

## Section 1: Null Bytes and Control Characters

Normal text followed by null byte:This text contains a null byte:  and continues after it.

Here are some control characters that break parsers:
- Bell character: 
- Backspace: 
- Form feed: 
- Vertical tab: 
- File separator: 
- Group separator: 
- Record separator: 
- Unit separator: 

## Section 2: Malformed UTF-8 Sequences

Incomplete UTF-8 sequence: �
Overlong UTF-8 encoding: ��
Invalid continuation bytes: ���

## Section 3: Mixed Binary and Text

More text after binary data.

## Section 4: Zero-Width and Invisible Characters

Zero-width non-joiner: word‌word‌separated
Zero-width joiner: word‍word‍joined
Left-to-right mark: ‎text‎with‎marks
Right-to-left mark: ‏text‏with‏marks‏
Line separator:  
Paragraph separator:  

## Section 5: Surrogate Pairs and Private Use

High surrogate without low: �
Low surrogate without high: �
Private use characters: ��
Unassigned code points: ��

## Section 6: Extreme Long Lines

This is an extremely long line that goes on and on and on and repeats the same content over and over to test buffer overflow and memory allocation limits in text processors that might not handle extremely long lines properly, causing them to crash or consume excessive memory when attempting to parse this ridiculously long line that seems to never end and continues indefinitely with the same repetitive content designed to stress test parsing systems and break text processing algorithms that assume reasonable line lengths but instead encounter this monstrosity of a line that just keeps going and going like the Energizer bunny but for text processing nightmare scenarios where normal assumptions about text structure completely break down and parsers have to deal with pathological input that no reasonable person would ever create except for the specific purpose of breaking things which is exactly what this line is designed to do by being unreasonably long and repetitive and annoying and designed to cause problems for any system that tries to process it in a normal way because normal text processing assumes that lines have reasonable lengths but this line violates that assumption completely and utterly and without any regard for the poor parser that has to deal with it.

## Section 7: BOM and Encoding Issues

UTF-8 BOM at wrong position: ﻿This text has a BOM in the middle
